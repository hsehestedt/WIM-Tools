' Perform some initial setup for the program

' This program makes use of "wimlib-imagex.exe" and "libwim-15.dll" to modify the install.wim
' so that the product type is set to "server". Doing this will allow an upgrade install of
' Windows on unsupported hardware. We are embedding those files into this program and we will
' extract them if and when they are needed.

' Release Notes
'
' 1.0.0.001 - July 20, 2021
' This is the first BETA release of the program. This is the original WIM Tools program but restructured to work with only Windows 11
' and not Windows 10. Technically, this program will work with Windows 10 as well but only x64 editions. In fact, this is the whole
' difference. Since Windows 11 is x64 only (64-bit) and there is no longer an x86 version (32-bit), we have removed all the portions
' of the program that handle x86 and dual architecture images. This greatly simplifies the program. Currently, this has resulted in a
' size reduction of about 30% in the code size. While I have not yet performed any performance testing, it is possible that some
' operations may be faster.
'
' This version is feature complete, but in depth testing to look for any bugs or issues still needs to be performed.
'
' 1.0.0.002 - July 20, 2021
' Since projects created by this version of the program will only have a single WIM file because no dual architecture images are used,
' we changed all references to "WIM files" to "WIM file" (singular) in putput messages.
' For the routine that creates bootable media from an ISO image, we added a check to make sure that the ISO image is x64 architecture.
' This was not needed in the original program because x86 and dual architecture images were permissable.
'
' This version of the program has also undergone testing and is the first production release of the program.
'
' 1.0.0.003 - July 21, 2021
' Very small change - Modified the icon to differentiate it from the original program.
'
' 1.0.1.004 - August 2, 2021
' Added the ability to pause program execution. For the routines that inject updates, drivers, or boot-critical drivers,
' execution can use quite a few resources, especially disk resources. When viewing the status on the screen, as progress
' goes to the next item in the list, we will check the desktop for a file named "WIM_PAUSE.txt". If such a file exists,
' execution will be paused until that file is deleted or renamed. If execution is paused a flashing message will be
' displayed to make the user aware of this.
'
' 1.0.2.005 - August 12, 2021
' Modified routines that check for elevated status. The first routine to be altered is the routine right at the start of the
' program. It was found that if the program was saved with certain characters in the file name, this routine would fail. For
' example, if program were to be renamed to "John's Program.exe", then it would fail. This corrects that situation. As an
' added benefit, this change makes the startup look better. Previously, if the program was not started elevated, the
' process of closing the original program and then relaunching it elevated caused a visible second window to be opened before
' the first one was closed. With this change that is no longer an issue.
'
' In addition, the routine that exports drivers from the system creates a batch file that also has the code to self-elevate.
' That code was also updated to resolve the same problem of not working when the batch file has certain characters in the name.
'
' 1.1.0.006 - August 16, 2021
' For the routine that will create bootable Windows installation media, we have made some improvements to make the user
' experience better. First, we create an empty text file with a unique name to the first two partitions when a "Wipe"
' operation is performed. In the future, if the user wants to perform a "Refresh" operation, we will search for these files.
' The purpose of this is to detect if more than one bootable drive created with this program exists. If more than one such
' drive is connected, then we need to ask the user for the drive letters to be refreshed. Otherwise, if only a single such
' drive is connected, we automatically detect the drive letters to be updated so that we don't need to bother the user for
' those details.
'
' 1.1.1.007 - August 16, 2021
' Added a line to the main menu to indicate the edition (Dual Architure or x64 Only). The name of the source file and the
' resulting executable have also been changed to clearly differentiate between the editions.
'
' Undid a recent change to the self-elevating code. It turns out that this was causing the code to actually NOT self-elevate.
'
' 1.1.2.008 - August 17, 2021
' After further investigation into the self-elevating code issue, we now have a more robust solution. The comments in that
' section of code explain how it works.
'
' 1.1.3.009 - August 24, 2021
' For the routine that creates bootable media, we have increased the amount of time that we wait for BitLocker to initialize
' a disk if the user chooses to create BitLocker encrypted partitions. This should ensure that even very slow media, such as
' some thumb drives, have enough time to initialize. In addition, added a block of text to better guide the user when they
' choose to create additional partitions.
'
' 2.0.0.010 - August 26, 2021
' This is a major new release. Comprehensive help has been added to the program.
'
' 2.0.1.011
' Added comments to the new help system in order to make the code easier to read and locate specific
' help topics within the code.
'
' 2.0.2.012
' Performed some tidying-up of the text in the new help section.
'
' 3.0.0.013 - September 2, 2021
' Another new major version. For the routines that inject Windows updates, drivers, or boot-critical drivers, the program can
' automatically generate a script file complete with comments. The comments make it easy to manually modify or "tweak" the
' script file. These script files can then be played back automatically by the program.
'
' 3.1.0.014 - September 2, 2021
' Added the ability still create a script without actually having to carry out an injection of updates, drivers, or boot-critical
' updates. Also improved the look of the screen asking if user wants to perform any scripting operations.
'
' 3.1.1.015 - September 2, 2021
' Added a hint to the status screens to remind user that they can use AUTO_SHUTDOWN.TXT and WIM_PAUSE.TXT files on desktop
' to perform an automatic shutdown or pause the program execution.
'
' 3.1.2.016 - September 3, 2021
' Bug fix - the final ISO image created by the routines to inject Windows updates, drivers, and boot-critical drivers was
' lacking the ".ISO" extension on the filename. This has been resolved. Also fixed a bug where script file may fail to be
' moved to the program directory after it is created.
'
' 3.1.3.017 - September 3, 2021
' Bug fix - In the help section, the organization of drivers for the routine that injects drivers did not accurately
' show the folder structure that should be used. Made a few other changes to the help for clarification purposes.
'
' 3.1.4.018 - September 7, 2021
' Confirmed for sure that there are times where the ei.cfg file is still needed. Fortunately, this was never removed from the code
' as originally planned. We simply gave a user the option to insert an ei.cfg file or not. Removed any comments from the code that
' stated that this file may no longer be needed, but leaving the functionality alone.
'
' 3.1.5.019 - September 8, 2021
' Refined the help message regarding the injection of an EI.CFG file to make the purpose of that file clearer. In addition, in other
' places in the program, when a user wants to see help, any response staring with the letter "H" would be acceptable to get help.
' This did not work for the prompt for an EI.CFG file. This has been changed to be more consistent with the rest of the program.
'
' 3.1.6.020 - September 16, 2021
' Rewrote the "pause" routine. This was a very simple routine that simply printed a blank line and then paused execution of the
' program until the user hit a key. The pause was accomplished by running the command line utility "pause" from a QB64 "shell"
' statement. For most purposes this is fine, except that it would not take input from the QB64 keyboard buffer. As a result,
' taking a series of commands and pasting them into the program would not work when a pause is encountered. This also has the
' potential to cause problems if we want to expand scripting capabilities in the future. The rewrite of this routine solves this.
'
' 3.1.7.021 - September 17, 2021
' We have 2 two "DO...LOOP" structures in the rewritten "PAUSE" code. These loops run forever waiting for a key press and release.
' Revised these structures so that they only look for a press or release 50 times per second to avoid hammering the CPU.
'
' 3.1.8.022 - September 24, 2021
' Fixed a bug that only happens when program goes back to start and reinitializes. For example, after a routine is run to completion
' and we return to the main menu. Right near the start of the program we stored the current working directory in a variable so that
' we knew the location from where the program was started. However, we then change the working directory to a temporary location
' where we can create temporary files. When jumping back to the start, we clear all variables and loose track of the original
' working directory. As a result, it is essential that we change the current working directory back to the original location before
' we jump back to the beginning of the program.
'
' Also added a note in the help for scripting to make users aware that changing contents of directories can cause script failures.
'
' Finally, the shutdown option was not working when the system was locked. The program was missing a "/f" option to force the
' shutdown. Without this, a shutdown cannot be performaed when the system is locked. We also provide a chance to abort dhutdown.
'
' 3.2.0.023 - September 26, 2021
' Made some significant changes specifically to better accomodate scripting. If the number of files in a source folder changed,
' this would break scripting because it changes your responses when the program asks if you want to update each individual file.
' To eliminate this problem, the program will now allow you to specify a full path including a file name. This way the program
' does not need to inquire about each file because you are specifying each file unambiguously.
'
' In addition, the script files are now a little easier to read and manually modify.
'
' 3.2.1.024 - September 27, 2021
' Further refinements to the scripting. The script files are much easier to read and edit. Blank lines are now legal and not interpreted
' as an <ENTER>. An <ENTER> is now explicitly shown with an "<ENTER>" tag in the script.
'
' 3.2.2.025 - September 27, 2021
' Bug fix. In the process of adjusting scripting settings, we caused a display problem for those routines that want to show index details
' but do not honor scripting settings (playback, record, or skip). This has been resolved.
'
' 3.2.3.026 - October 2, 2021
' Bug fix. At the concluion of a process, the program tries to dele the antivirus exclusion that it setup earlier and then delete a
' tracking file. It's possible that the tracking file may not exist and result in a program crash. This has been resolved.
'
' 4.0.0.027 - October 5, 2021
' This is a major new version!
' The option to create bootable media now has 2 options. The previously existing option to create a single Windows boot option along
' with multiple generic partitions to hold other data remains as was. However, we now have the option to create media that allows for
' multiple bootable partitions. For example, you could boot Windows 10 setup / recovery media, Windows 11 setup / recovery media, Macrium
' reflect recovery media, and any other Windows PE/RE based bootable media, as well as several generic partitions for holding any other
' desired data. This functionality is only for x64 / UEFI based systems and not BIOS or x86 based systems.
'
' 4.0.1.028 - October 5, 2021
' Bug fix. Even if a user did not want to hide operating system and Windows PE / RE partition drive letters, we were hiding them
' anyway. This has been fixed.
'
' 4.0.2.029 - October 11, 2021
' Minor change. Reworded some text in the routine that reorders Windows editions within an image for clarity.
'
' 4.0.3.30 - October 12, 2021
' Fixed a bug where we were skipping over an entire section of code becase we had a call to a subroutine commented out.
'
' 4.0.4.31 - October 12, 2021
' Bug fix: Still dealing with the code to create bootable media. Under a specific set of circumstances we were running the
' code to ask the user what disk write the image to twice. This has been resolved.
'
' 4.0.5.32 - October 13, 2021
' Minor change - Updated some text displayed to user for clarity.
'
' 4.1.0.33 - October 20, 2021
' Microsoft now distributes the the SSU and LCU in one combined package. We have changed our code to work with this new model.
' Note that this may look a bit odd at time becaue we apply the LCU and then apply it again. This is because the first time the
' SSU get applied, the second time, the LCU gets applied. Note that if we were loading certain optional components such as language
' packs, etc., these componts would get installed right between thos two occurences of the LCU update for both WinRE and WinPE (boot.wim).
'
' 4.1.1.34 - October 21, 2021
' Added a couple of lines to the section of code that cleans up project files. In rare circumstances, a user could abort the program
' at a point in time where cleanup of files becomes difficult. We've added a couple lines to try to even more aggressively try to
' cleanup such files.
'
' 4.1.2.35 - October 21, 2021
' Changed some wording of on screen progress indicator. With the new combined SSU and LCU updates, it appears that if an SSU exists,
' the first pass (where the SSU would be applied) completes rather quickly, and then the LCU is added on the second pass which can
' take quite a while. However, if no SSU exists, then it seems that the first pass already applies the LCU and the second pass
' completes almost instantly since there is nothing left to be done. The wording of the progress screens is now changed to reflect
' the fact that the SSU and LCU are combined and we simply call the 2 passes "pass 1" and "pass 2".
'
' 4.1.3.36 - October 23, 2021
' Changed the wording of a few messages in the routine to extract the contents of .CAB files for clarity.
'
' 4.1.4.37 - October 25, 2021
' Changed wording on a menu item.
'
' 4.1.5.38 - November 24, 2021
' For the option to display WIM image information, we have added a few lines at the end of the output to show the build number of the
' Windows editions in the image. Help has been updated to note that this information is displayed.
'
' 4.1.6.39 - January 11, 2022
' For the routine that injects updates, after the user enters a filename or path for the source, we need to determine if what was
' entered is a filename or a path. There was a bug in this logic causing a fault in the program if a path was entered. This is now
' resolved.
'
' 4.1.7.40 - January 12, 2022
' When updates are being injected into Windows images, the screen that shows the current progress is very much reliant upon being
' properly sized as 120 x 30. If the user has either accidentally or purposely changed the size of the program window, the status
' screen will not look very good at all. As a result, each time we refresh the status display, we will now reset the screen to
' a size of 120 x 30.
'
' 4.2.0.41 - January 13, 2022
' We had previously introducednew functionality to the routine for creating bootable media to allow for the creation of media that
' could boot multiple Operating Systems and / or WinPE / WinRE based media such as various recovery disks, etc. This routine is
' being removed at this time, but may be added back at a later date. There are several reasons for this:
'
' 1) We have seen several occurences of BSODs with no clear understanding yet of the cause.
' 2) The result looks sloppy - there is no nice boot menu and the resulting boot is also inconsistent on different systems. On some
'    systems you will see a boot menu item for each partition (both FAT32 and NTFS) while some systems show only the FAT32
'    partitions. It just looks sloppy and seems a little half-baked when compared to the rest of this program.
'
' 4.2.1.42 - January 14, 2022
' Permanently removed the option that we described as having disabled in the Jan 13, 2022 release notes. It's clear that if we are
' ever to bring back this functionality a major rewrite of that code would be needed.
'
' 4.2.2.43 - January 17, 2022
' Rewording of a menu item and help text for improved clarity.
'
' 4.2.3.44 - January 24, 2022
' Added the ability to easily switch the program between applying separate SSU updates or combined LCU / SSU updates.
' At the start of routine to inject updates, if we set ProcessSeparateSSU to 1, then we process a separate SSU update.
' If set to 0, then we process a combined LCU / SSU update.
'
' 4.2.4.45 - January 25, 2022
' When injecting Windows updates, there was a logic flaw. At the end of the process, we were moving the install.wim to the final
' destination. However, this results in a significantly larger file. Rather than simply moving it, we should be exporting each
' index to the destination. We correctly perform a cleanup operation on the install.wim, however, the cleanup has no effect on
' the size until an export is performed. So, as a result of neglecting to perform the export, we miss out on the benefit of the
' cleanup that was performed earlier. This has now been corrected.
'
' 4.2.5.46 - January 25, 2022
' Found that there was still a discrepancy in the size of final ISO image created by a batch file that I was using and this
' program. Noted that there was a significant difference in the boot.wim size. That led to the discovery that a variable I
' was using was wrong in some places. There was both a SSU_Update_Avail$ and an SSU_Updates_Avail$. This has been corrected.
' In addition, we were moving the original boot.wim to the final location rather than the updated file. This too has been corrected.
'
' 4.3.0.47 - February 10, 2022
' If in an effort to finally put the issue of how to properly apply combined LCU / SSU updates, we have performed so testing. Microsoft
' documentation says that SSU updates should be applied first, followed by certain other updates, and then the LCU should be applied.
' From my testing, it looks like this information is now outdated. For an online installation of Windows this may still apply, but it
' seems that for an offline servicing of a Windows image, the following should be done:
'
' 1) For WinRE.WIM - Apply the combined LCU / SSU update at the time where the SSU would normally be applied.
' 2) For BOOT.WIM (WinPE) - Apply the combined LCU / SSU update at the time where the LCU was previously applied and apply nothing where the
'    SSU was previously applied.
' 3) For INSTALL.WIM (the main OS) - Apply the combined LCU / SSU update at the time where the LCU was previously applied and apply nothing
'    where the SSU was previously applied.
'
' 4.3.1.48 - February 12, 2022
' Noticed recently that performing a "clean" within diskpart on a flash drive will often fail the first time it is run. Oddly, it always works
' the second time. It seems that this affects not only manually running the command, but affects this program as well. As a result, we simply
' run the "clean" command twice.
'
' 4.3.2.49 - February 13, 2022
' Came accross a program that needs to access the .WIM files in a Windows image. For some silly reason, this program is sensitive to the case
' of the file names, wanting only lowercase characters. There are places in the program where we were saving these file names using uppercase
' characters. This has been changed to use all lowercase.
'
' In addition, we have made a change to all ISO image creation routines. The timestamp of all files added to the image will now be set to the
' time at which the creation of the image was started. This will allow for easy identification of when an image was created.
'
' 4.3.3.50 - February 18, 2022
' Further refinement to the "clean" operation on media that we are writing to. There is a problem where performing a "clean" in diskpart will
' sometimes fail the first time. It usually works the second time but in testing with batch files we have seen failures even on the second
' time. The failures only seem to happen on MBR disks. As a result, we are performing a clean operation twice, attempting to set it to GPT
' each time. Finally, after a third clean we set it to the final desired state of either GPT or MBR.
'
' 4.3.4.51 - March 16, 2022
' Very minor changes to wording of some text in help. No functional changes in this update.
'
' 4.3.5.52 - March 17, 2022
' Another minor change: The routine to display Windows image information is one of the few pieces in this program that was intended to be able
' to handle both images that contain an install.wim file as well as those that use an install.esd file. We were not handling this correctly
' This has now been corrected. Along with this change we changed the temporary test file that was used to store information from WIM_Info.txt
' to Image_Info.txt.
'
' 5.0.0.53 - March 18, 2022
' Major new release: Added a new feature to the menu. There are a lot of people who have ISO images using an install.esd rather than an
' install.wim. There are occasions where the release of an image with .wim may be delayed by a few days and only the .esd version of the
' image is available. As a result, we now have the ability to convert an image with an install.esd into an image with an install.wim.
' In this x64 only edition, we only support conversion of single architecture images.
'
' 5.0.1.54 - March 19, 2022
' Revised the help menu so that help topics align with the actual menu item numbers. Previously, the numbers were offset by one. For
' example, menu item 1 was help topic 2.
'
' In addition, for this x64 only edition of the program, the versioning information was not updated causing wrong version information
' to be displayed.
'
' 5.0.2.55 - March 20, 2022
' Very minor update: In the built-in help, under the topic for the routine that injects drivers into Windows images, on the third page of
' the help topic "5) Organizing update files", there is a section for "SSU". This topic has been removed since Microsoft has now switched
' to a combined LCU / SSU model. This means that an SSU folder is no longer needed and a seperate SSU does not need to be downloaded.
'
' 5.0.3.56 - March 21, 2022
' At the last moment prior to compiling the last release, we accidentally introduced a bug causing the final image to not be created in the
' new routine that converts ESD images into WIM images. This has been fixed.
'
' 5.0.4.57 - March 21, 2022
' This update contains no change in functionality.  A few messages in the help sections were updated to make the messages clearer.
'
' 5.0.5.58 - March 23, 2022
' Completely revised the logging to make it far simpler. Logs were sometimes being generated that were 600MB+ in size and this was
' simply getting out of hand. We have also made one small change to the behavior of the routine that converts ESD files to WIM. Since
' we are simply performing a conversion and not altering the image in any other way, we are no longer altering the timestamp of files
' when we create the final ISO image.
'
' 5.1.0.59 - March 26, 2022
' In a little further refinement of the logging, we cleaned up some messages related to logging. In addition, we have enhanced the auto
' shutdown capability by adding the ability to hibernate rather than a shutdown. This is implemented by the user placing either an
' auto_shutdown.txt or an auto_hibernate file on the desktop.
'
' In addition, we found that when updates were injected into images by running a script, some important messages at the end of the
' program execution could be skipped since script playback skips all pauses where messages would normally be displayed to the user.
' This has been corrected.
'
' 5.1.1.60 - March 28, 2022
' No functionality changes. Previously, the initial variable declarations separated the variables declared as SHARED from those that were
' not. For sake of ease, these were merged with the other variables. Now, to find a variable declaration we simply need to find it in the
' list alphabetically since variables were already alphabetically arranged. We no longer need to look in more than one place.
'
' 5.1.2.61 - April 15, 2022
' Made some changes to the startup of the program prior to the main menu being displayed. We now determine if the current version of the
' program has ever been run before. If not, we display a message to the user encouraging them to review online help. In addition, we
' instruct them to run the program elevated if self-elevation fails due to their system settings. Also fixed a small bug where a file
' named Win_Info.txt was specified but it should have been Image_Info.txt. This did not not result in any functional issues, simply
' an extremely minor cosmetic issue.
'
' 5.1.3.62 - May 9, 2022
' No functional changes. Marking as stable build following extensive testing.
'
' 5.1.4.63 - May 23, 2022
' No functional changes. Corrected a comment that had an incorrect date and recompiled with the latest QB64pe version (0.7.1).
'
' 6.0.0.64 - June 8, 2022
' Major new version. Added the ability to create a bootable disk that can contain as many different ISO images as you wish. These
' can include various versions of Windows as well as Windows PE and Windows RE based media.

' 6.0.1.65 - June 11, 2022
' Performed much work on the code that was just added to allow creation of multi boot images. Rather than being a whole entire
' separate section of code, this is merged with the code to create a single image boot media. This gives us all the capabilities
' that the single image code had such as being able to add additional partitions, choose BitLocker encryption, etc.
'
' 6.0.2.66 - June 12, 2022
' Made some major changes to help topics covering the sections that were updated in the past few builds.
'
' 6.0.3.67 - June 13, 2022
' Determined a way to allow an override and create GPT media for media created to boot from multiple different ISO images. The
' code now implements this putting a multi image boot media on parity with the single images and providing all the same capabilities.
'
' 6.0.4.68 - June 15, 2022
' Fixed a section of code in which responding with a path with spaces but not enclosed in quotes was not being parsed correctly.
'
' 6.0.5.69 - June 17, 2022
' The program was not working with paths and filenames that contain commas. This has been corrected.
'
' 6.0.6.70 - July 3, 2022
' When booting from a disk created as Windows multi image boot disk, under certain circumstances, it was possible that a couple of
' "Access Denied" messages could be displayed and cause the user to question if everything was okay. Everything was working fine,
' but this issue has been addressed to eliminate that concern.

' 6.0.7.71 - July 6, 2022
' Found a logic bug in testing. When creating a multi image boot disk, we create a batch file that the user can run to restore the
' original state of the media. We had that batch file auto delete itself after being run. This was faulty logic. That batch file
' should not be deleted.
'
' 6.1.0.72 - July 7, 2022
' Major rework of the routine to create a bootable disk with a single Windows image or multiple Windows images plus WinPE and WinRE
' based media. Made a lot of changes to messages, fixed a lot of spelling / sentence structure issues, cleaned up status displays,
' made interaction with the user more friendly, and more.
'
' 6.1.1.73 - July 11, 2022
' No change in functionality. Simply cleaned up a user message.
'
' 6.2.0.74 - July 21, 2022
' Performed an overhaul of the routine that creates a VHD and deploys Windows to it. This includes a bug fixe and much better
' communication to the user of steps that they need to take.
'
' 6.2.1.75 - July 23, 2022
' Corrected a single spelling error.
'
' 6.2.2.76 - August 6, 2022
' Removed the last line of the "Restore_Disk.bat" batch file. This line read "END" which is an invalid keyword.
'
' 6.2.3.77 - August 14, 2022
' Minor update: For the routine "Make or update a bootable drive from one or more Windows / WinPE / WinRE ISO images", when
' all operations have been completed, we display usage instructions to the user. With each screen of instructions, the screen
' is dismissed by pressing any key. If any keys were accidentally pressed while the operations are in progress, these will be
' retained in the keyboard buffer and will then cause the messages at the end to be dismissed. In order to make sure that the
' user will see the messages, we are now clearing the keyboard buffer before we display these messages.
'
' 6.3.0.78 - August 14, 2022
' Added a minor update to flush the keyboard buffer for several other sections of code, just as was done for the
' "Make or update a bootable drive from one or more Windows / WinPE / WinRE ISO images" routine.
'
' 6.3.0.79 - August 25, 2022
' No code changes. The only change made is that we are compiling on the newly released QB64PE 3.0.
'
' 6.3.1.80 - September 2, 2022
' Minor change: When exporting drivers for a system, we created a batch file that could be used later to install
' the drivers. At the end of that batch file, we display a message to the user and pause. We no longer do this.
' This allows us to call that batch file from another batch file without it pausing and holding up execution.
'
' 6.3.2.81 - September 6, 2022
' In the routine to create a universal, bootable UFD, we made a change to create a batch file that gets saved on volume 2.
' That batch file allows to UFD to be custom configured without having to boot from the UFD. We also updated the text that
' is displayed after the UFD is created to explain how this batch file can be used.
'
' 6.3.3.82 - September 11, 2022
' Fixed some flaws in the routine to inject boot critical drivers.
'
' 6.3.4.83 - September 30, 2022
' Rearchitected parts of the routine to create a bootable disk that allows for the selection from multiple ISO images. The
' routine now creates a single batch file that can be used to check the status of the disk, to select an image to make bootable,
' or to revert the disk back to the state where no image is yet selected.
'
' 6.3.5.84 - October 1, 2022
' For robocopy commands, we often have error checking code to make sure that we have not run out of space on the destination. However,
' the error correction is never triggered because robocopy tries over and over after a 30 second delay. To resolve this, we have added
' a /r:0 to the robocopy commands to tell robocopy not to retry. This will allow the code to fall through to the error checking code.
'
' 6.3.6.85 - October 2, 2022
' Minor tweak: In the routine that creates a universal bootable disk, we had to copy the "choice" command to the disk because it is
' not present in Windows PE. We have modified the code so that this command is no longer needed.
'
' 6.4.0.86 - October 20, 2022
' The method used to inject Servicing Stack Updates (SSU) has been completely rearchitected. Microsoft listed a known issue in the
' latest Windows patches for which a workaround is listed. That issue affects only people who inject updates into Windows images.
' The workaround describes how to extract the SSU from the combined SSU / LCU update package. Previously, Microsoft did not describe
' how to do this. As a result, we were using a method devised by trial and error. This method works, but we are now applying the SSU
' using the method described by Microsoft.

' 6.4.1.87 - October 31, 2022
' Cleared the keyboard buffer at the end of a few more code sections to make sure that messages to the user are not overrun.
'
' 6.4.2.88 - November 9, 2022
' In the routine to create a universal boot disk that will allow for selection from multiple ISO images, we have eliminated the
' need for a user to provide a temporary location to build the WinPE image. In addition, the message that is displayed to a user
' the first time the program is run, suggesting the review of help and instructing what to do if the program cannot self-elevate
' has been revised. It will no longer be displayed after new versions of the program are installed. It will now truly be shown
' only one time.
'
' 6.4.3.89 - December 7, 2022
' Made some changes to the help file contents to make to information presented easier to understand.
'
' 6.4.4.90 - January 9, 2023
' No code changes other than these comments. Simply moving to the new QB64PE version 3.5.0 to compile the code.
'
' 6.5.0.91 - January 10, 2023
' While working with the mitigation for a Microsoft vulnerability related to BitLocker and the Windows Recovery Environment, it was
' discovered that Microsoft documentation regarding how WinRE.wim should be updated may not be correct. Although documented otherwise,
' it appears that applying the LCU to the WinRE.wim may in fact be necessary even though all indications from Microsoft are that the
' LCU does not apply to WinRE.wim. The program has been updated to apply the LCU in addition to the updates that are already being
' applied (the SSU and the SafeOS Dynamic Update).
'
' 6.5.1.92 - February 8, 2023
' For the routine that displays basic WIM information, we have added the ability to display the build number of both the boot.wim
' and winre.wim images.
'
' 6.6.0.93 - February 9, 2023
' Updated the online help to reflect the changes made in version 6.5.1.92.
'
' 6.6.1.94 - March 7, 2023
' Remove the message that is shown the first time running the program. This message unexpectedly gets displayed again whenever the temp
' folder gets cleaned out, and the message is simply proving more annoying than useful.
'
' 7.0.0.95 - March 31, 2023
' Add the ability to update the registry settings in the BOOT.WIM to bypass Win 11 system requirement checks.
'
' 7.1.0.96 - April 5, 2023
' When making physical boot media, we default to creating the first partition with a size of 2.5 GB. Often, this is way more space than is
' needed. However, it is enough space that it can cause the second partition to be too small to hold even a single Windows image on an 8 GB
' disk. To resolve this, we now give the user an option to specify the size of the first partition.
'
' 7.1.1.97 - April 12, 2023
' For the routine that injects registry changes into the BOOT.WIM to bypass Windows 11 system requirements, if a user opted to copy the
' final file over the source file, replacing the original source after the update, we would then delete the entire project file. We
' have modified this behavior so that any ISO files that were originally located in that location would be left in place. This allows
' the user to use the same project folder for multiple operations such as injecting Windows updates, without having to remember to move
' the resulting ISO file every time for fear of the next operation deleting it.
'
' 7.1.2.98 - May 1, 2023
' Minor change to some text for better readability.
'
' 7.1.3.99 - May 3, 2023
' For the routine that creates a multiboot disk from which the user can select the image to be booted, we have made a few changes. If the
' selected image contains an autounattend.xml answer file, we no longer move it to the second volume. We leave this file on the first volume.
' By doing this, the answer file is deleted when we revert the disk back to the original state, rendering the disk safe to boot from. Note
' that it is possible that a user could manually place an autounattend.xml answer file on the second volume. For safety, when we revert the
' volume back to the original state, we delete this answer file if it is present and display a note to the user that any answer file that
' may have been present has been deleted.
'
' 7.1.4.100 - May 8, 2023
' Made a number orf refinements and enhancements to the routine that creates a VHD and deploys a new instance of Windows to it.
'
' 7.1.5.101 - May 8, 2023
' Made a number of refinements to how we find available drive letters. In addition, we should now be able to correctly handle corner cases
' where detecting drive letters in use by removable media that was BitLocker encrypted but has had a "clean" operation performed on it, did
' not always work properly.
'
' 7.2.0.102 - June 16, 2023
' Made many refinements to the routine that creates Windows bootable media and multi image boot media.
'
' 7.2.1.103 - June 18, 2023
' More refinements to the routine that creates Windows bootable media and multi image boot media.
'
' 7.2.2.104 - August 5, 2023
' Completely rewrote the help that describes how to organize Windows updates for projects where updates are injected into Windows image(s).
'
' 7.2.2.105 - August 5, 2023
' In the new routine to inject Windows system requirement bypasses into the BOOT.WIM, it was realized that the first prompt for the image
' to be updated was not clear. This has been updated to specifically ask for the Windows ISO image file in order to avoid confusion.
'
' 7.2.2.106 - August 7, 2023
' Very minor change. Corrected text describing the purpose of the ei.cfg file.
'
' 7.2.2.107 - August 8, 2023
' Minor change. Changed text that read "to updated" to "to be updated".
'
' 7.2.2.108 - August 10, 2023
' Made some minor changes when asking a user if they want to include an EI.CFG file as it was reported that this option may be confusing.
'
' 7.2.2.109 - August 14, 2023
' Minor change: Clarified the prompt to the user for the location of the Windows update files to clarify that the user does not need
' to include the x64 or x86 folders in the path.
'
' 7.2.2.110 - September 14, 2023
' Very minor change: There is no change in functionality. We simply changed the wording of the main menu item for creating a VHDX to indicate
' that Win 11 23H2+ includes this capability in the GUI. We also updated the help for this feature.
'
' 7.2.3.111 - September 22, 2023
' For the routine that creates a multiboot disk that allows the user to select from a list of ISO images to make bootable, we have found
' that if a previously created boot.wim file was used, we would sometimes fail if the system was booted from the media without a boot
' selection having been made prior to the boot. This is because search the media for the volume label but the volume label that we
' embedded in the boot.wim may not be valid for the current project. This has been corrected so that we no longer look for the volume
' label. We now look for the tags named "VOL1_M_MEDIA.WIM" and "VOL2_M_MEDIA.WIM" instead.
'
' 7.3.0.112 - September 25, 2023
' Modified the code that allows creation of a multi image boot disk to display a list of available unattended answer files and allow the user
' to select an answer file to use if they wish to do so. Eliminated the need to check volume labels in the bootable media in order to be able
' to perform a refresh operation.
'
' 7.3.0.113 - November 2, 2023
' Corrected an issue that was causing the boot.wim updates to not be properly applied.
'
' 7.3.0.114 - November 21, 2023
' Revised the procedure for syncing mismatched files. It appears that only setup.exe files now need to be synced.
'
' 7.3.0.115 - December 2, 2023
' Updated the help to reflect recent changes in the program. In addition, when the users views the status of a multi boot disk by running
' the Config_UFD.bat file, we now report what answer file is configured for use if one was selected.
'
' 7.3.0.116 - December 3, 2023
' Made a number of refinements to the batch files created ny the multi disk boot reoutine.
'
' 7.3.0.117 - December 5, 2023
' Made a very minor change to the command line for OSCDIMG when creating a generic ISO image.
'
' 7.3.0.118 - December 6, 2023
' Made some further enhancements to the batch file used to configure a multi ISO image boot disk.
'
' 7.3.0.119 - January 3, 2024
' Updated the help section to reference a new type of update - the OOBE ZDP update.
'
' 7.4.0.120 - January 18, 2024
' Microsoft released some information that has led to the most recent changes. First, it was discovered that even though Microsoft
' now includes SSUs in the same package with the LCU, there can be rare circumstances where a Standalone SSU may be released. The
' program is now prepared to handle this. In addition, after injecting all the Windows updates, there is a step where we sync
' files that may be out of sync between Windows PE and the media outside of any WIM. Updated the sync procedure to include all
' needed files.
'
' 7.4.0.121 - January 21, 2024
' Previously, based upon a WinRE vulnerability from January 2023, we had added a step to apply the LCU to WinRE. However, this step
' is now no longer needed so we are removing that step from the update process.
'
' 7.4.1.122 - March 5, 2024
' Very minor change: There are several spots in the program where we read the entire contents of a file into a string. This process
' requires about 5 lines of code. QB64 now has a new "_READFILE$" command that performs all 5 lines of code in a single file. More
' importantly, it is so much easier to read. As a result, we have replaced all occurrences of the old code with this new command.
' This makes no change to the functionality of the program, just cleans things up in a few spots in the program.
'
' 7.5.0.123 - April 11, 2024
' Made a few changes to the routine that deploys Windows to a VHD for native boot. No change in functionality has been made, only some
' messages were changed for the sake of clarity. We have also added a message asking the user to NOT deploy the VHD to a drive that is
' encrypted with BitLocker.
'
' 7.5.0.124 - April 18, 2024
' Further refinement to messaging for the tool that installs a dual-boot Native VHD installation of Windows.
'
' 7.6.0.125 - May 8, 2024
' With the latest mitigations for the BlackLotus UEFI Bootkit released in April of 2024, it is necessary to apply an additional patch
' after the disk has been created. This patch needs to be applied from a system that already has these mitigations applied. As a result,
' we will check to see if the system on which we are running has these mitigations applied. If the mitigations are applied, we will
' automatically apply the patch. If the mitigations are not applied, we will suggest to the user that this patch be applied from a
' system that has the mitigations installed.
'
' PENDING - The code implemented today has not been test with dual artitecure images. It's possible that some of the commands we are
' using are not placing files in the correct location on dual architecture media. This needs to be looked into. We are placing this
' as a low priority since we are moving away from all dual architecture support. If it works as is, that's just a lucky bonus.
'
' In the section that creates a generic ISO image file, we were specifying the use of UDF version 2.0. This seems to sometimes cause
' problems. As a result, we stepped this back to UDF version 1.02.

' 7.7.0.126 - May 24, 2024
' Ironically, we are removing the changes that were just made. This because the new ADK and Windows PE versions for Windows 24H2 have
' now been released and these no longer require patching.
'
' 7.8.0.127 - June 7, 2024
' With the latest Windows Insider Release Preview ISO image (build 26100.560), physical media created by this program would not run
' correctly. We have discovered that by creating a copy of the "boot", "efi", and "support" folders on the second partition of the
' bootable media, we resolve this problem. These folders are very small (currently about 42MB), so this should pose no operational
' difficulties.
'
' 7.8.0.128 - July 18, 2024
' Minor change: Removed the registry entries for BypassCpuCheck. This no longer appears to be needed. Note that we have commented out
' those lines rather than removing them entirely just in case the need for these entries ever reappears.
'
' 7.8.1.129 - July 23, 2024
' Found that when changing the NAME and DESCRIPTION metadata for a Windows edition, updating these fields for more than one image does
' not work. This has been resolved. The problem was that we were missing a double quote mark (") at the end of the command to change the
' name and description metadata.
'
' 7.8.1.130 - August 12, 2024
' No functional changes to the program were made. This update is merely to note that we have switched to the new version of the QB64PE
' compiler (version 3.14).
'
' 23.0.0.261 - August 26, 2024
' No functional changes to the program, however, we come to the point in the program where we finally transition completely to x64 only
' support. As a result, we are adopting a new versioning scheme for the x64 only version to bring it into alignment with the scheme used
' for the dual architecture version of the program.
'
' 24.0.0.262 - October 8, 2024
' Finally! We have working 24H2 support. It turns out that one additional file needs to be copied from the boot.wim to the install.wim
' file that was not needed previously. That file is "setuphost.exe".
'
' 24.0.0.263 - October 10, 2024
' Since Windows 11 24H2 introduces Checkpoint and Incremental updates in place of the previous cumulative updates, the status screens
' needed to be updated. We now reflect that we are applying servicing stack updates and cumulative / checkpoint / incremental updates.
' We have also updated HELP to reference checkpoint / incremental updates.
'
' 24.1.0.264 - October 13, 2024
' Added a new capability: We can now set the tag for the "Installation Type" of the Windows editions in an image to "Server". This
' eliminates the need to run "setupprep /product server" when performing an upgrade installation on unsupported hardware. By setting
' this tag you can perform an upgrade installation on unsupported hardware without needing to do anything; no commands need to be run,
' no registry entries need to be set, nothing at all needs to be done. It will just work. For this same routine, we have updated the
' progress display to be clearer. Finally, the HELP system has been updated to reflect the recent changes.
'
' 24.1.1.265 - October 25, 2024
' For the routine that adds bypasses for systems that do no meet Win 11 requirements, the initial ISO image name is always Windows.ISO.
' We have changed this to ask the user for the name to use.
'
' 24.1.1.266 - December 15, 2024
' No code changes, created a new version simply to recompile under the new QB64PE 4.0.0 compiler.
'
' 24.2.0.267 - January 19, 2025
' Updated the routine that converts an install.esd into an install.wim so that it can also convert an install.wim into an install.esd.
'
' 24.3.0.268 - January 20, 2025
' Further updated the routine that allows conversion between Install.WIM and Install.ESD files. Rather than only being able to convert
' these files only from an ISO image, we can now point to an individual file as well.
'
' 24.3.1.269 - February 24, 2025
' Add clarification to messages indicating that a valid x64 folder does not exist to clarify that why an x64 subfolder is needed.
'
' 24.3.2.270 - February 26, 2025
' Windows 24H2 has introduced a new setup experience. Under investigation now is a problem where injecting Windows updates will
' sometimes cause a clean installation to fail. For a manual installation this is easy to overcome because the setup GUI provides an
' option to run the previous setup. However, this is a problem when run unattended setup. We have added the ability to the routine that
' patches Windows so that it can be installed on technically unsupported hardware to also optionally allow forcing the use of the previous
' setup. This will cause both manual and unattended setup to use the previous setup, but it is really only necessary for unattended setup.
'
' 24.3.2.272 - Feruary 27, 2025
' Very minor update. This update makes no functional changes, just changes the messaging around the updates made yesterday. When we added
' the functionality to force Windows to use the previous version of setup, we believed that there might be an issue with the program. That
' turned out not to be the case. Days after the problematic Windows update, additional supporting updates (Safe OS and Setup Dynamic
' Updates were released. So, technically, nothing in the program needed to be changed. On the plus side we have gained the functionality of
' being able to force the previous version of setup to be used.
'
' 24.3.3.273 - March 5, 2025
' Added the ability to add boot critical drivers to the boot.wim used to create bootable Windows media. Note that this only affects media that
' is created to allow the user to select from multiple images to boot from. This is because the the standard type of boot media is created from
' an ISO image file, so if additional drivers are needed, these should be injected into that ISO image first.
'
' 24.3.4.274 - April 4, 2025
' This release has no change in functionality. We merely corrected some text in a message that was not properly worded.
'
' 24.3.4.275 - April 29, 2025
' Minor change: Corrected a path that is incorrectly displayed. The path is displayed with two backslashes (\\) where only one should be shown.
' Note that this has ne effect on functionality of the program. This is just a minor cosmetic issue.
'
' 24.3.5.276 - June 19, 2025
' Minor change: For the "Other" folder where we place .NET FX updates as well as any other updates that do not fit into other categories,
' we were searchiong for iles with only the .MSU extension. I UUP update was released today that had the .NET update as a .CAB file rather
' than the usual .MSU. This shows a flaw in logic here - since anything could be put in this folder, we should really be searching for all
' files rather than just files with a .MSU extension.
'
' 24.3.6.277 - June 26, 2025
' For the routines that inject updates into a Windows ISO image, keystrokes that were made following a script or made while the program
' was running might cause the final status screen to be dismissed when switching to it. This has been resolved.
'
' 24.3.7.278 - July 11, 2025
' After creating a multiboot disk that allows the user to select an ISO image to make bootable, we display several screens to explain the
' usage of the disk that was created. We have updated some text in this area for improved clarity. No functional changes were made in this build.
'
' 25.0.0.279 - August 21, 2025
' Add a major new feature - an unattended answer file generator.
'
' 25.0.1.280 - August 24, 2025
' Added a batch file version of the unattended answer file generator to the batch file that configures a multiboot disk. So now the user has
' the option to use previously made answer files or generate one on the fly.
'
' 25.0.1.281 - August 25, 2025
' Updated the help section to reflect the recent chages. Fixed a bug in the new code that could cause the Config_UFD.bat file to crash
' if no answer file was present in the "Anser Files" folder of a multi boot disk create with this program.
