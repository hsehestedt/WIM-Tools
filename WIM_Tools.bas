' Release Notes
'
' 7.5.2.28
' Moved release notes to end of program.
'
' Updated the "Make a bootable drive from a Windows ISO image or update an already existing drive" routine to display a note stating that a disk
' created with this routine will only use 2TB of capacity since the disk will be initialized as MBR rather than GPT. This is needed to make the
' disk bootable on both BIOS and UEFI based systems.
'
' Added ability for user to override this behavior so that the program will create the disk with GPT rather than MBR. This will allow a disk that
' is larger than 2TB to use its entire capacity but sacrifices the ability to boot on a BIOS based system.
'
' Compiled with QB64 Feb 10, 2020 dev build
'
' 7.5.2.29
' Added a check at the end of the "Make a bootable drive from a Windows ISO image or update an already existing drive" routine to parse any DISM.LOG files and
' check for potentional errors. To do this, we read each line in the log and check for the word "Error" starting at the 22nd character in the line.
'
' Compiled with QB64 Feb 10, 2020 dev build
'
' 7.6.0.30 - Feb 13, 2020
' After testing the changes made in 7.5.2.29 I noticed that DISM log files were being overwritten. For example, if you update 5 editions of Windows, 5 seperate
' log files are created but only a DISM.LOG and DISM.LOG.BAK are kept. I have modified the code to rename each log file after it is created so that all log files
' are maintained, at least until the program is run again at which time it will purge old logs. As a result of now maintaining all these logs, it can take a very
' long time to parse all the log files when checking for errors. Because of this, I give the user an option to skip the log file check for errors, although I do
' suggest to them that they allow the check to take place.
'
' I also discovered that Console Title Bar messages were not getting properly displayed. This is because one of the items that I was displaying was the Program
' Version which I store in ProgramVersion$. I had to DIM this variable as shared so that it would be accessible in SUB sections of code.
'
' Compiled on the new QB64 version 1.4, released on the same day as this build.
'
' 7.6.0.31 - Feb 13, 2020
' Since the log files scan at the end of the "Make a bootable drive from a Windows ISO image or update an already existing drive" routine can take a long time to
' process, I have updated the routine to terminate as soon as an error is detected. That way, if we find an error fairly early on, we can save a lot of time since
' there is no reason to read the rest of the current log or any further log files. In addition, we now report what log file the error was found in and the line
' number within that log where the error was detected along with the contents of that line.
'
' Compiled on QB64 Ver. 1.4
'
' 7.6.1.32 - Feb 14, 2020
' At the start and end of the DISM log file scan for errors for the "Make a bootable drive from a Windows ISO image or update an already existing drive" routine,
' Display the date and time that the operation was started and completed. I may pull this code eventually, but for now it will serve as a way to gauge how long
' this process takes. That way, if I tweak the error scanning code I can better tell if this is improving or hurting performance.
'
' Compiled on QB64 Ver. 1.4
'
' 8.0.0.33 - Feb 15, 2020
' This is a major update. The sections called  "Inject Windows updates into one or more Windows ISO images (one edition per image at a time)" and
' "Inject drivers into one or more Windows ISO images (one edition per image at a time)" have been completely removed. The first of these sections
' was fairly useless since the first item in the menu basically has all the functionality of that section plus more. The latter section for injecting
' drivers has been merged into the code for injecting updates. Most of the steps for injecting updates and drivers are the same so it made sense to
' simply merge these into one routine. This has resulted in the removal of hundreds of lines of code. In addition, the two routines had very different
' status displays and in general just had a very inconsistant look. Now, there is a very consistant and unified look to the two operations.
'
' The routine called "Strip the time and date stamp from filenames" has also been removed because it is no longer needed with the above changes.
'
' In addition, the following minor improvements have been made:
'
' Routines that create bootable images previously would exclude any autounattend.xml file to prevent a situation where a user might accidentally boot
' from media that would start automatically installing Windows and wipe out their existing Windows installation. This has been changed so that the
' user is now informed of this situation and then asked if they want to exclude any autounattend.xml answer files.
'
' Updated a couple of messages for clarification. Also, for the recently added ability to scan DISM logs for errors, we have removed the question to
' the user to ask if that scan should be performed. After testing it has been determined that this should be mandatory because we want to avoid a
' situation where we end up with a useless final image without the user being aware of the situation.
'
' 8.0.0.34 - Feb 16, 2020
' Minor tweaks. Changed the working of text in a few spots and added color to a few areas.
'
' 8.0.0.35 - Feb 17, 2020
' Minor tweaks. There are a couple of options that need some explanation. The explanation for both is a little long. I changed
' these screens so that the use needs to type HELP to get a full explanation. This means that the screen will be much cleaner
' without all the extra information that the user probably only needs to see once.
'
' 8.1.0.36 - Feb 18, 2020
' Redid the routine to ask user if they want to configure a drive as GPT rather than MBR if the drive is larger than 2 TB.
' Prior to this update, the user was asked about this every time, now we only ask the user about this if the disk they selected
' is larger than 2 TB. Otherwise, we don't bother to ask.
'
' When creating a bootable disk, values had to be entered in MB and were displayed in MB only. Now, values can be entered in MB, GB,
' or TB, and are displaed in the most appropriate format as well.
'
' Compiled on QB64 ver 1.4
'
' 8.1.0.37 - Feb 19, 2020
' Changed the DIM statements for a few variables to DOUBLE to make sure we can hold the large numbers needed for storage space in the routine
' to create bootable media. Disk space is specified in MB and on very large disks these values can be large numbers.
'
' 8.2.0.38 - Feb 21, 2020
' In the routines for injecting updates and drivers as well as the routine to create a bootable ISO image that can include multiple editions and
' architectures, the ability to specify "ALL" for the index numbers has been added. This eliminates the need to have to display a list of the
' available editions to determine how many of them are present if you want to add all of them.
'
' Eliminated the DisplayIndices subroutine since it is no longer used in the program after recent changes.
'
' 8.2.0.39 - Feb 21, 2020
' Squashed a bug. In several places within the program, we would not detect that an ISO image was invalid if it contained an INSTALL.ESD
' rather than an INSTALL.WIM. This has been corrected.
'
' 8.2.0.40 - Feb 21, 2020
' Fixed a bug that was introduced in 8.2.0.39. When checking the validity of an ISO image, we were checking for a file called
' \x64\install.wim. This is incorrect. We should be checking for \x64\sources\install.wim. The result was that valid dual architecture
' images would be flagged as invalid. This issue has been corrected.
'
' 8.2.0.41 - Feb 23, 2020
' Up until now, the program was hard coded to run DISM and OSCDIMG from the default install locations. With the update, we query
' the registry for the install location and store that in a variable. As a result, we can run correctly even with the ADK installed
' to a non-default location. We can also warn the user if DISM.EXE or OSCDIMG.EXE are not found.
'
' 8.2.0.42 - Feb 23, 2020
' Further refinement of the ADK detection introduced in 8.2.0.41. Since some routines can be run without needing the ADK,
' rather than simply exiting the program, we warn the user that the ADK is not installed but then proceed to the main menu.
' If a menu selection is made that requires the ADK, we again warn the user that the ADK needs to be installed and return to
' the main menu rather thanrunning that routine.
'
' Also updated the branding. In some areas we referenced this program as simply "WIM" (Windows Image Manager) rather than
' "WIM Tools". This has now been made consistent throughout the program.
'
' 8.2.0.43 - Feb 24, 2020
' Performed some tidying up. Cleaned up the spacing before and after loop structures, added and reworded a few comments, declared every variable used in the
' program, changed variables that were declared as DOUBLE to LONG.
'
' 8.2.0.44 - Feb 26, 2020
' Modified the wording of a couple of messages to make them clearer.
'
' 8.2.0.45 - Feb 28, 2020
' Based upon an error encountered, we have add some error handling to the MountISO SUB procedure. If we cannot get a valid CDROM ID or drive letter for an
' image that we have mounted, we display an error message along with the CDROM ID and drive letter that we retrieved, and we then trminate the program.
'
' 8.2.0.46 - Feb 28, 2020
' Added some color to a message to highlight what we are asking for. This is in the routine for injecting Windows updates or drivers. If a dual architecture
' image is selected we ask if the user wants to add any of the x86 and any of the x64 editions. We are now highlighting "x86" and "x64" in the message to
' the user to make absolutely clear what we are asking for.
'
' 8.2.0.47 - Mar 01, 2020
' When the program is started, it will now add itself to the exclusion list for Windows Defender antivirus scanning. When you choose "Exit" from the main menu, it will
' remove itself from the exclusions. This will prevent a whole bunch of exclusions from being created if the filename or path from where the program is changed frequently.
' If the program is NOT terminated by selecting "Exit", simply run the program again FROM THE SAME LOCATION and choose "Exit" to remove the AV exclusion.
'
' 9.0.0.48 - Mar 13, 2020
' Major new version! I discovered that in addition to updating the main OS (INSTALL.WIM), the WinPE (BOOT.WIM) and WinRE (WINRE.WIM) components should also be
' updated. This program will now update those components when updates are injected. This required some major work to the program. In addition, this required a
' change to the layout of the updates in the folder supplied by the user. Please see the documentaion for details on how to organize your updates. Also revised
' the cleanup routine to properly handle the new folders and mounts for DISM used by the system.
'
' 9.0.0.49 - mAR 13, 2020
' The routine to inject drivers shares most of the same code with the routine to inject Windows updates. Before running the routine to inject updates we
' ask the user if they want to exclude an AUTOUNATTEND.XML answer file from the project if that file is present. At the very end of the routine where we build
' the final directory structure from which to create our ISO image, we check to see what choice the user made regarding excluding the answer file. However, before
' running the routine to inject drivers, we were asking about this. This in turn caused the logic for building the directory structure to massivly fail. This
' has been fixed by adding a single line of code to call the routine we neglected to include.
'
' 9.0.0.50 - Mar 13, 2020
' Minor fix - I neglected to updated the version number that is displayed with the 9.0.0.49 release. Correcting this.
'
' 9.0.0.51 - Mar 15, 2020
' Found and corrected a logic fault: We were grabbing the WinRE.WIM from the very first x64 and first x86 edition of Windows being processed and then
' using that file in all the other editions. The problem is that the WinRE.WIM is not present in a syspreped image. If a sysprep image was either the
' only or the first edition to be processed, then no WinRE.wim would be found. If a sysprep image was included but not as the first or only image, then
' a WinRE.wim from another edition would get inserted. We have fixed this logic.
'
' 9.0.0.52 - Mar 16, 2020
' Chased down some more bugs in the newly added routines. Much of problem I was chasing was the result, once again, of stale mounts open by DISM. Will need
' to remind users that interrupting program while a WIM is mounted by DISM can cause major difficulties and that cleanup will need to be undertaken. I am
' strongly considering greatly enhancing the cleanup routine so that it will do a true verification of any potential stale DISM mounts and report to the user
' if it cannot clean these up.
'
' 9.0.0.53 - Mar 16, 2020
' For the routines that inject Windows updates or drivers into a Windows image, we now check for, and attempt to resolve, any stale open DISM mounts. If the
' program cannot resolve the situation automatically, then we post a warning to the user suggesting a reboot and we exit the program.
' We also revised the cleanup routine (where user selects the cleanup option from the menu). First, it will try to clear all stale DISM mounts, not only
' those just in the directory specified. Second, in the event that a stale mount does exist, the revised routine shuld be far faster.
'
' 9.0.0.54 - Mar 17, 2020
' Reworked the DISM log file scan at the end of the routines to inject updates and drivers. Previously, it could take
' a couple minutes to process each log file. Now, we can process 25 log files in a matter of only a few seconds (3 seconds
' on my laptop).
'
' 9.0.0.55 - Mar 18, 2020
' Now that we can process a log file so quickly, rather than waiting until the routine ends, we are checking the log files at the end of each Windows edition
' that we process. If we do encounter an error, we inform the user, call the cleanup routine, and then take the user back to the main menu.
'
' 9.0.0.56 - Mar 18, 2020
' Found and fixed yet more logic bugs in the new WinRE and WinPE processing. Really hoping that this concludes this section.
'
' 9.0.0.57 - Mar 24, 2020
' Discovered that an error would getted logged in the DISM file if we tried to perform an update of a type that did not exist. As an example, suppose
' there are no servicing stack updates. An error would get logged when we tried to perform a servicing stack update. Added logic to intelligently skip
' any attempt at an update type that we don't have. NOTE: This was not a problem previously but with the new checking of the logs for errors it is a problem.
'
' 9.0.0.58 - Mar 24, 2020
' In the routines to inject updates and drivers, changed the wording in the status display to differentiage between an "image" and a Windows "edition".
'
' 9.0.0.59 - Apr 6, 2020
' In the routines to inject Windows updates, inject drivers, and Create a bootable Windows ISO image that can include multiple editions and
' architectures, we perform a check to see if the user is saving the project to removable media. If they are, we inform them that the
' project must be created on a HD. After that, we inform the user that they will be asked if the final ISO image should be moved after it is
' created. This would allow them to move the final image to removable media if they wish. The functionality of moving the final ISO image is
' not actually in the program. As a result, we have removed that part of the message so as not to mislead the user. We may add that capbility
' at a later time.
'
' 9.0.0.60 - Apr 8, 2020
' Neglected to update fileversion at start of program on build 59. This has been corrected. Added OSCDIMG logging for the routines that inject updates and drivers.
' Ran into an issue where OSCDIMG would log this error:
'
' ERROR: Could not open boot sector file "c:\project\ISO_Files\boot\etfsboot.com"
'
' Error 3: The system cannot find the path specified.
'
' Not sure if that error is because that file is read-only. For all routines that create bootable Windows ISO images, when we create the base image
' I have added a "/a-:rsh" to the robocopy commands clear the read-only, system, and hidden attributes from the files being copied to create the base image. In those routines
' where we are not creating a base image, I've added an "attrib" command to clear those attributes from the source files before we create the final image.
'
' In any case, encountering this error now is odd since I've never run into it before.
'
' 9.0.0.61 - Apr 12, 2020
' Modified program so that all temporary files will now be created in the TEMP directory. This will avoid visible files from appearing and disappearing
' in the location where the program was launched. To accomplish this, we also had to modify the behavior of the WimInfo.txt file that we gave the user
' an option to save. This was a text file that displays WIM information to the screen and could optionally be saved to that file. The previous behavior
' was that the file would simply be renamed from WimInfo.txt to WimInfo_Saved.txt right where it was located. Now that the file is created in the TEMP
' directory, we are simply moving it to the location where the program is located. It has also been renamed to WIM_Info.txt.
'
' 9.0.0.62 - Apr 12, 2020
' For the routines that inject updates and drivers, added the ability for the user to specify the final ISO image name being created. This will
' avoid confusion after a long running project and forgetting what the project was. Also found in flaw in the routine that checks for the existance
' of updates after the user specifies the update location. We were only checking for the existance of a Latest Cululative Update, but it's
' possible that user may only be applying another type of update(s). This has been corrected.
'
' 9.0.0.63 - Apr 13, 2020
' It appears that the registry key that I was searching for to verify that the ADK is installed on the system may change with the version of the ADK installed.
' A member of TenForums was kind enough to check for the existance of this registry key on his system since he is running a newer BETA of the ADK. Sure enough,
' that key does not exist on his system. I have determined a better registry key to check that makes a whole lot more sense and implemented it. This should be
' good even with newer versions.
'
' 9.0.0.64 - Apr 13, 2020
' In the routine that creates a VHD and deploys Windows to it, we are increasing the size of the EFI partition from 100MB to 260MB.  While this may not
' matter for a VHD it is nandatory for 4K advanced format drives. This places it inline with my procedures for all systems.
'
' 9.0.0.65 - Apr 14, 2020
' Increased limits on some arrays to 100 to allow up to 100 elements to be processed in a project. Also, for very long lines of code, these were split using
' an "_" to allow continuation on another line. This makes the code easier to read.
'
' 9.0.0.66 - Apr 14, 2020
' In reviewing some code I noticed that not all REDIM statements in the program had an AS TYPE clause. Corrected this to avoid potential problems.
'
' 9.0.0.67 - Apr 14, 2020
' A bug was introduced in build 9.0.0.63 when the change was made to the ADK path. This was a critical error that would cause the ADK to fail becaause the path
' was not properly built. Corrected and tested.
'
' 9.0.0.68 - Apr 15, 2020
' Corrected some text from "Do you want use at least one Windows edition".... to "Do you want to use at least one Windows edition"
'
' 9.0.0.69 - Apr 21, 2020
' When injecting updates, the status display treated the addition of of the Servicing Stack Update (SSU_ and the Latest Cumulative
' Update (LCU) as one item. To make the status just a little bit more granular, this has been changed so that the SSU update and the
' LCU update are broken up into two seperate lines.
'
' 9.1.0.70 - Apr 22, 2020
' Back in build 62 the ability to specify the final ISO image name in the routine that inject Windows updates as well as the routine
' to inject drives was introduced. This is now possible in the "Create a bootable Windows ISO image that can include multiple editions
' and architectures" routine as well. Since there have been a lot of changes recently, it's also time to bump the version number up
' from 9.0.0 to 9.1.0.
'
' 10.0.0.71 - May 30, 2020 (Updated version at start of this line, incorrectly listed this version as 9.2.0.71 in the actual release.)
' After much research and testing, found a way to create dual architecture images without the need for asking a user for a dual
' architecture image. All files needed to create a base image can be obtained from x64 and x86 media; some files from the x64 media,
' other files from the x86 media. The one exception is that two different files, both named "bcd" are needed from the dual
' architecture media. The breakthrough came in that a way has been found to recreate those files from plain text which allows the
' creation of those files on the fly from within this program.
'
' 10.0.1.72 - June 10, 2020
' The first time updating the final release of Windows 10 2004 I found that errors were being logged by DISM. After the project
' was done, Windows installed just fine, so these may not be fatal errors. I am investigating this. In the meantime, I have
' updated how errors are handled. Rather than stopping ast the first error, the status screen will show a message indicating
' that an error was detected. We save all errors to a seperate log file that stores nothing but errors as well as what log
' those errors came from and a timestamp. When the routine is done, we remind the user that errors were detected and point them
' to this log file.
'
' 10.0.2.73 - June 10, 2020
' Reword a couple of places in the program where we display text that says "working on image"... Changed this phrase to "working on edition" for accuracy.
' In addition, where a user has an option to update multiple editions in an image, if a user responded "ALL" when asked what editions to update, there
' was a bit of pause that might make one wonder if the response supplied was received. Changed this to immediately display a status message as soon as a
' response is provided by the user.
'
' 10.0.3.74 - July 14, 2020
' When injecting updates into Windows editions, after each edition is updated we parse the DISM log file to see if any errors were reported. If so,
' we display a message that errors were detected and inform the user that more information will be displayed after the routine is done running, in
' other words, when all editions have been updated. Prior to version 10.0.1.72 as soon as we detected an error we would abort the program. In
' version 10.0.1.72 we changed that behavior because a bug that I confirmed with Microsoft is causing errors but these can be ignored. So, the only
' change made in this version is to inform user that they can check the log file as soon as the program displays the message indicating errors.
' There is no need to wait until the program is done.
'
' 10.0.4.75 - July 17, 2020
' For the routine that creates a VHD and deploys Windows to it, we asked for the index number to use before we gathered other information. While this
' worked, the ordering of the information gathering just seemed out of place. Also improved the messaging to the user in this section of code.
'
' 10.0.4.76 - August 3, 2020
' Very minor update. For some reason the words "partition" and "partitions"  were mispelled in several locations. This has been corrected.
'
' 11.0.0.77 - August 20, 2020
' Major new revision: Added a whole new capability; the program can now add boot-critical drivers to the WinPE and WinRE images.
'
' 11.0.1.78 - August 21, 2020
' Minor change. For the routine the displays WIM information, if the user chooses to save a copy of the output to a file we now
' display a message to let the user know the full path and filename of the saved file. This makes it clear for the user exactly
' where to find the file. In addition, if the user elects to not save a copy of the output to a file, then rather than displaying
' a message that says "done", we will simply return to the main menu.
'
' 11.0.2.79 - August 28, 2020
' There are several places in the code where we create an ei.cfg which is placed in the \sources folder of the Windows media.
' This file is no longer needed. Rather than remove that code entirely, those sections have been commented out for now just
' in case any reason should ever be found to reinstate that code.
'
' 11.0.3.80 - August 31, 2020
' A change in direction from the last update. Rather than completely disable the creation of the ei.cfg file, we are now asking
' the user if they want to create an ei.cfg file.
'
' 11.0.3.81 - September 4, 2020
' Minor change. The main menu item number 10 had the line indented one space too far. corrected this.
'
' 11.1.0.82 - September 9, 2020
' This update adds the ability to inject generic files into the WinPE image (boot.wim). This can be helpful for purposes such as
' the addition of a script to create disk partitions (useful for creating the WinRE partition last). In addition, the recently
' added code to allow boot-critical drivers to be injected introduced a bug where the x86 version of that code would run when
' the user was adding Windows updates, not boot-critical drivers. This has been fixed.
'
' 11.1.0.83 - September 10, 2020
' Very minor update that does not affect functionality at all. The prompt for making a selection from the main menu was crowded
' right up against the menu above it. Moved the prompt down one line. It just looks a little better.
'
' 11.1.1.84 - September 11, 2020
' Fixed a bug. The recently added code to add generic files to the boot.wim file used a generic variable named "x" to keep count of
' the number of files to be copied. Unfortunately, this was done within another loop that was already using that same variable name.
' As a result, that variable was being incorectly altered. To fix this, we changed over to a different unused variable (z).
'
' 11.1.2.85 - September 11, 2020
' For the routine that reorders entries in the ISO image, I found that if the source and destination are the same directory, the original
' file is not replaced. There is no error, the symptom is simply that the reordering of Windows editions never happens. Investigation
' shows that this was due to the original file still being mounted, making it impossible to overwrite the file. To correct this, the
' dismounting of the original file was moved up to just before we create the new file. In addition, changed a couple of messages to the
' user in this section. The program displayed messages with the word "image" where "index" would be more accurate. Corrected this.
'
' 11.1.3.86 - October 31, 2020
' With the release of Windows 10 20H2 there appears to be a bug with applying the Latest Cumulative Update (LCU) to the Windows PE
' image (boot.wim). When the LCU is applied to boot.wim and Windows is installed using an image that incorporates that update,
' Windows fails to detect the HDs during setup and displaying a message that a media driver is missing. To work around this issue
' for now, we ask the user if they want to skip SSU and LCU updates for Windows PE. The user can elect to skip these updates which
' will prevent the problem from happening. Note that any user files to be added or deleted from the WinPE image are unaffected.
' Even if user skips application of SSU and LCU updates, these files will still be properly processed.
'
' In addition, if the routine to inject updates finds errors in the log files, and that routine is run a second time without first
' exiting the program, the program will indicate that errors were found even if none exist. This is because a flag that indicates
' that errors were found does not get reset when the routine is first started. This has been corrected.
'
' Changed references to "Disk ID" in the program to "disk number" as this terminology could be confusing, especially in the context
' of how the disk IDs were displayed where they are simply presented with disk numbers.
'
' 11.1.4.87 - November 2, 2020
' The routine to change the NAME and DESCRIPTION metadata was not working. The problem was tracked down to a wrong path being stored
' in a variable that is supposed to contain the full path to the ImageX.exe executable. Rather than specifying Imagex.exe it was
' referencing DISM.exe. This has been corrected.
'
' 11.1.5.88 - November 24, 2020
' Microsoft has released a new type of update for the Latest Cumualtive Update (LCU) known as a "GDR-DU" (General Deployment
' Release - Dynamic Update). This file is distributed as a >CAB file rather than as a .MSU file as the LCU has always been
' released previously. Since this program checks the folder where the LCU is located for a .MSU file, the program has now
' been modified to look for either a .MSU or a .CAB file. Either will be considered acceptable. The commands that actually
' inject the updates into the Windows image dis not need to be modified since they handle .CAB files as well as .MSU files
' without any changes at all.
'
' 11.1.5.89 - November 26, 2020
' No changes to the code other than updating the build number, the release date and the release notes. The purpose of this
' build is simply to recompile the program using the Nov 4, 2020 development build of QB64.
'
' 11.2.0.90 - December 9, 2020
' Several improvements have been made to the routine that creates bootable media from an ISO image or to update already
' existing boot media. First, it is no longer necessary for the user to supply drive letters for all the partitions
' being created. The user now has the option of letting the program automatically assign drive letters, however, if they
' would still prefer to assign drive letters manually, they can do so. In addition, the volume names that were assigned
' to the partitions all started with "USB". This has been changed because this routine can be used with non-USB based
' media such as SD cards and HDs attached via other means than USB.
'
' A few other minior tweaks were made as well. The wording of a few messages were slightly changed. When user enters the
' desired size for partitions, the display has some coloring added to it to better highlight the values provided and for
' which partitions responses are still pending.
'
' Finally, starting with this build, we move to compiling using QB64 December 7, 2020 development build.
'
' 12.0.0.91 - December 12, 2020
' Elevating version number to a new major version number in recognition of all the major enhancements made recently.
'
' Yikes! Neglected to remove some code for testing. This has been corrected. Also corrected a spelling mistake that was noticed in a comment.
' When creating a boot disk, if the user chooses to perform a refresh operation, we now maintain the volume label. This is important
' if you rely on the volume label for anything. As an example, I use a script that references the volume label rather than relying on
' drive letters which can change. Also, when performing a wipe operation, rather than a prefined set of volume labels the user is now
' prompted for volume labels.
'
' When creating a bootable Windows disk with additional partitions, if the user elected to enable BitLocker and BitLocker failed,
' for example, if the same password was not entered twice, the program would proceed with no warning to the user and no chance to
' try again. This has been corrected. The user now has 3 trys. If it still fails, the program will continue gracefully but will
' warn the user that BitLocker will need to be enabled manually.
'
' Finally, the dimensioning of one variable that was used only in testing but is no longer needed was removed
'
' 12.0.1.92 - December 12, 2020
' The version info had a typo - it was listed as 10.0.0.91 but should have been 12.0.0.91. This has been corrected. Also, there
' was a section of code that saved data to the clipboard. This has been changed so that the program will no longer alter the
' contents of the clipboard.
'
' 12.0.2.93 - December 14, 2020
' A solution to the previously identified problem of updates to the WinPE image (boot.wim) causing setup to fail has been identified
' and implemented in the code. Microsoft's own documentation was to blame. The documentation neglected to note that for the 2nd index
' in the boot.wim file, when exporting with DISM, a "/bootable" switch should be used. Oddly, prior to the October 2020 updates, the
' lack of this switch did not cause any difficulties. However, from October onward, this caused problems. Thi switch has now been
' added. In addition, a simple bypass for the code asking a user if they wanted to skip updates for WinPE has been implemented. This
' is much safer than trying to address all the sections of code where this is implemented, and allows us to easily restore that
' functionality if needed by simply commenting out 2 lines of code. If all is well, we may consider cleaning up this code at a
' future time.
'
' 12.0.2.94 - December 15, 2020
' No code changes at all in this update (other than the version number and this note). This build is simply a reversion back to QB64 1.4
' for compiling. It's not that any problems were found in the development build, but just want to ensure that I am on a stable release
' and not risking any problems by being on a development build.
'
' 12.0.3.95 - December 18, 2020
' I was bored so I made a few minor tweaks. There are no functionality changes with this update. I simply reworded a few prompts
' and added a few colored highlights for emphesis here and there. Noticed that I used the word "images" where I meant "editions"
' so I corrected that.
'
' 12.0.4.96 - December 18, 2020
' Again, no functional changes. Just cleaning up and rewording some messages to something I like better and adding a few more color highlights.
'
' 12.1.0.97 - December 19, 2020
' There is Microsoft issue that has been around for a while (quite a few months) that cause DISM to log false errors. Because of this issue,
' messages are being displayed to the user which would cause undue concern. I've disabled the code that shows these status messages for now.
' This is a bit frustrating because, if there are any real errors to be aware of, the user will not know until the update routine is done
' and that could be a considerable amount of time. Related to this, the logging has now been revamped. We still have the log file called
' ERROR_SUMMARY.log that contains all errors, but we also create a new log file called SANITIZED_ERROR_SUMMARY.log that sanitized the
' log and removes all of the known false errors. Comments are present in the code to easily undo the bypassing of the error staus messages.
'
' 12.1.1.98 - December 20, 2020
' Squashed a rather nasty bug discovered while testing another function. In the option to create an ISO image from one or more editions of
' Windows, it was discovered that if a dual architecture image was being created, the entire x86 folder would be missing from the final image.
' Analysis: There one section of code that runs if dual architecture image is available. This section of code makes use of an existing dual
' architecture image to copy all the files that we need to create a base image for a dual architecture project. However, if all the images
' in the project are single architecture, but we have a combination of both x64 and x86 editions of Windows, then we need to take a different
' series of steps to create the base image. The problem was that after the first section of code was run, we should have had a simple GOTO
' statement that would skip over the second section code. The idea is that we only need one or the other section of code depending upon the
' circumstances. However, this GOTO statement was missing. As a result, we ended up running both secontions of code with bad consequences.
' Naturally, this has now been corrected.
'
' 12.1.2.99 - December 20, 2020
' Performed a little bit of revamping for the feature to allow reordering of Windows editions wihin an image. Added help to the prompt
' asking for the index order because it may not have been readily obvious that indicies, including a range of numbers can be entered in
' either ascending or descending order or a combination of both. Cleaned up the text for a few more messages.
'
' 12.2.0.100 - December 21, 2020
' Performed a few changes to the routine that reorgaized the Windows editions within an ISO image. We always have allowed the user to
' specify the same folder as both source and destination. This causes the original file to be overwritten with the new file. The problem
' with this logic is that if the user does not specify all indices, then some editions will be omitted and we would loose Windows editions.
' Just to add a little bit of safety, if the user specifies the same source and destination folder, we will now inform them that the
' original file will be replaced with the new one.
'
' In addition, this routine creates several temporary folders and a file in the destination folder. To be on the safe side, we now check
' to see if any of these already exist. If any are already present we inform the user and ask them if it is okay to erase these.
'
' 12.2.1.101 - January 1, 2021
' No new features. Cleaned up / reworded some messages and performed some minor touchups. For the moment we have no major updates
' to address or bugs to squash so we are taking the time to make some very minor adjustments. Found a number of references to a
' variable named ArcTag$. Nowhere in the code is this variable ever set to anything so I have removed all references to it. Just
' in case this proves to cause any difficulties, go back to version 12.2.0.100 to review where that variable was used. Added some
' more comments to just a few variable definitions to explain there usage. This is a very low priority so I may continue to
' document the usage of variables here and there over time when I am bored. The release notes for version 12.0.0.91 contained
' the words "testcode" (with a space between words). I modified that wording because I use that exact phrase when placing code
' for testing in the program. This way, when I search for that phrase in the future, I won't find it when no code for testing is present.
'
' 12.2.2.102 - January 1, 2021
' Added a few more comments to variable definitions
'
' 12.2.3.103 - January 7, 2021
' A little more cleanup of messages, added so colors for emphesis. Today we focused on the routine to create a Virtual Disk.
'
' 12.2.4.104 - January 13, 2021
' There was a problem related to updating Windows PE (boot.wim). We implemented a workaround in a sub called Skip_PE_Updates_Check.
' This section asks the user if they want to skip WinPE updates and then skips those updates if the user wants to do so. Note that
' if the user has files that should be added or removed to the boot.wim (not Windows updates), those will still be applied. We had
' believed that we had found a solution to this issue (adding a /Bootable to the export command for index #2 of the boot.wim) but
' it turns out that this does not resolve the issue in all circumstances. Since the problem is now reoccurring again we are
' reactivating that code that we had disabled starting in build 12.0.2.93 on Dec 14, 2020.
' Also related to that same section of code, it was discovered that a "/Bootable" switch when exporting WinPE (boot.wim) Index #2 in
' the routine that injects updates into Windows editions was missing. That has been resolved.
' To summarize, the workaround code has now been re-implemented.
'
' 12.2.5.105 - January 14, 2021
' Added 2 more messages to the list of messages stripped off from the Sanitized Error Summary log.
'
' 14.0.0.106 - Jan 15, 2021
' FINALLY - I believe that we have a definitive answer to the Windows PE (boot.wim) upgrade issues. It's taking a fair bit of code to
' rectify the situation and we'll be testing the fix for at least a day or two, but I'm pretty sure we have it this time around. Since
' we now have a fix, we are disabling the Skip_PE_Updates_Check routine which was designed to ask a user if they wanted to skip the
' WinPE updates as a workaround for this issue. The code is still there and can be re-enabled by simply commenting out 2 lines.
' Please go to the Skip_PE_Updates_Check routine and see comments there for details.
'
' 14.0.1.107 - Jan 18, 2021
' Testing indicates that my thinking I had the definitive solution to the issue I described in the past several updates was spot on.
' Unfortunately, I had one small glitch. In one line of my code I built a command line to be executed but never executed that command.
' That problem was in the vicinity of the code I needed to fix this issue and it was pure chance that testing that fix revealed this
' flaw. That issue has now been resolved.
'
' 14.0.2.108 - Jan 19, 2021
' Added 2 more messages to the list of messages stripped off from the Sanitized Error Summary log.
'
' 14.1.0.109 - Jan 22, 2021
' Changed the order of menu items and reordered those major code subsections so that they appear in the code in the same order as
' reorganized menu items. The code sections really didn't need to be moved, It was just extremely easy to do and I thought it
' would be nice to keep it organized that way. As for the menu; it had never really occurred to me that the tools not really
' directly related to WIM management appear in the menu between WIM management functions. These tools have now been moved so
' so that all WIM management functions are grouped together and the other helpful, but unrelated tools, appear after these.
'
' 14.1.1.110 - Jan 26, 2021
' Variale type values assigned from FREEFILE command should be of type LONG but I was using the INTEGER type. There
' was no error observed but I thought best to correct this while I noticed it. This was noticed while addressing this
' issue: In the process of running this program on a system that had a BitLocker encrypted drive, AND that drive was
' also currently in a locked state, I discovered that the routine to find the next available drive letter would think
' that the letter assigned to a BitLocker protected drive  was available. This was corrected by performing a further
' check on any drive letter we initially believe to be free. If the _DIREXITS function indicates that a drive letter
' does NOT exist, we run a "manage-bde -status D:" (or whatever drive letter) command and parse the output. If that
' command includes "could not be opened by BitLocker" in the output, then we know that the drive really does not exist.
'
' 14.1.2.111 - Feb 3, 2021
' For the x64 code only, when exporting the boot.wim index #2 in the routine that injects Windows updates, we have
' neglected to hide the output of the DISM command performing the export. This causing some ugly output on the status
' screen. If may be very brief depending upon the speed of the computer, but it looks rather ugly and even on a fast
' machine causes a brief series of flashes and poor looking output. This has been corrected.
'
' 14.1.3.112 - Feb 4, 2021
' In a section of code where we are assigning drive letters to partitions, we open a file after determining the first available
' free file number and storing the value in the variable "ff". In that section of code, rather than referencing "LOF(ff)" we were
' referencing "LOF(1)". That happens to work because ff will likely always be equal to 1, but with future changes to the code, we
' cannot guarantee that this will be the case. This has been corrected to "LOF(ff)".
'
' In the routine that created a VHD, deploys Windows to it, and then adds it to the boot menu, we referenced a variable named
' IndexVal before it was set to anything. This was an error. At that point in the code, rather than reference a variable, we
' should simply be using a fixed value of "1". This has been corrected.
'
' 14.1.4.113 - Feb 4, 2021
' Revamped the entire routine to create a VHD, deploy Windows to it, and add it to the boot menu.
'
' 14.2.0.114 - Feb 25, 2021
' If a Windows edition has a pending operation, this will prevent DISM Image Cleanup operations from being performed. The program
' has been updated to inform the user if at least one Windows edition has been found to have pending operations. Note that this
' typically happens if NetFX3 is enabled on the Windows edition. If this happens, the user should update Windows editions that do
' not yet have NetFX3 enabled on them. After the other updates are applied or the install.wim has had the cleanup operation
' performed on it, NetFX3 can then be enabled.
'
' In addition to the above some very minor updates were made. For example, prompts for certain information to be supplied by the
' user would display a question mark where it was not needed at the end of the prompt. This has been corrected.
'
' 14.2.0.115 - Feb 25, 2021
' There are no code changes in this version other than to update the version number and to remove "_DEST _CONSOLE" since this is no longer
' needed in QB64 1.5. The main purpose of this version is simply to recompile the program using the new version 1.5 release of QB64.
'
' 15.0.0.116 - Mar 5, 2021
' Major new release. The initial work that was started in build 114 to check for pending operations on a Windows edition has been
' greatly enhanced. While we still display a message to the screen that we have detected a pending operation, we have also made
' major changes to the code that allow the original Windows images and editions to be tracked through the update process so that
' when a pending operation is detected we can log exactly what the original file and index that has the pending operation. This
' information is then saved to a log file so that the user can review the details.
'
' A few other more minor tweaks have also been implemented. For example, the operation to cleanup project folders has been
' enhanced to display the results in a clearer manner more consistent with the rest of this program.
'
' 15.0.1.117 - Mar 7, 2021
' In the section of code for injecting updates, even though I disabled the display on screen of error warnings there was a section of the
' message still being displayed refferring users to an error log. I have commented that out for now and may eventually remove it entirely.
'
' 15.0.2.118
' When adding updates to a Windows image, it's possible that no errors may be generated at all, even the false positives that we filter out
' in the program, depending upon what options the user selects. In this case, no file named SANITIZED_ERROR_SUMMARY.log will be created. In
' order to make the program a little friendlier, we check for the presence of this file at the end of the routine. If no such file exists,
' we no longer suggest to the user to take a look at that file to make sure all is good.
'
' In addition, in the process of looking at the above issue, it was noticed that there was a spot in the code where we reference "eof(1)",
' however the file was not being opened as #1, but was being referenced by the filenaumber assigned by the "freefile" function. The code
' was working fine because "freefile" happened to be #1 every time, but just in case any future code changes alter this, we have corrected
' this so the "eof" now references the variable that "freefile" is associated with.
'
' 16.0.0.119
' Added the ability to add an autounattend.xml file to the image in addition to other updates. The best way to accomplish this was by
' completely re-architecting the directory structure for the Windows updates. Since an answer file does not get placed in either the
' x64 or x86 folders we needed to make some changes. As a result, the program will no longer ask for the location of both x64 and x86
' updates. It will only ask for the location of the updates in general and will require that the updates folder have a seperate x64
' and x86 subfolder for the updates. Note that if only one architecture type is being processed, there is no need for a folder for
' the other architecture type. Within the updates location, in addition to the x64 and x86 folders, a "Answer_File" folder should be
' created. Within that folder will be the "autounattend.xml" if it is intended to be added to the project.
'
' Because this update fundamentally changes the structure of the updates folder that the user needs to supply, we are assigning a major
' new version number and including in the release notes information regarding this change.
'
' 16.0.1.120 - Mar 17, 2021
' The routine used to determine if the program was being run elevated has been reworked so that it is much shorter and now does not
' require the use of any variables whatsoever. In addition, it was moved to the very beginning of the program before we even dimension
' any variables.
'
' In addition, at the very start of the program, we have placed a CLEAR statement to wipe out all variables and arrays. After any routine
' is completed, rather than return to the main menu, we return to this point now. This keeps things tidy and limits memory usage. Granted,
' this program does not use much in the way of resources, but it seemed like a good thing to do.
'
' In the course of adding this CLEAR statement, a bug involving interaction of the CLEAR statement with a console was discovered and
' reported to QB64.org. A fix was developed that very same day (highly impressive!). This fix is implemented in the March 17, 2021
' development build of QB64. As a result, it is important to use that build or newer when compiling this program in the future.
'
' 16.0.2.121 - Mar 19, 2021
' Sloppy work - In the last build, a single line of cose was accidentally deleted which caused the routine to inject updates to fail
' to run. When selecting that option from the menu, an error would be returned saying that an invalid menu selection was made.
' This issue has been corrected.
'
' 16.0.3.122 - Mar 22, 2021
' No changes in functionality. Simply reworded a few messages to make their mening clearer.
'
' 16.0.4.123 - Mar 30, 2021
' In creating a boot disk from a multi-edition image previously created using this program, it was found that we were out of disk space
' on the intial FAT32 partition. As a result, we are updating the program to create a larger FAT32 partition. We will now create that
' partition with a size of 2.5GB rather than 2GB. While making this change it was also noted that one instance of the word "partition"
' was misspelled as "partion". This has been corrected.
'
' 16.0.5.124 - Apr 10, 2021
' Bug fix: When injecting updates into Windows editions, we output the results of command to a temporary file. That file is then
' parsed for the occurence of the stings "x64 Editions" and "x86 Editions". Also contained in that file is the name of the file
' itself. If that file name happens to contain "x64 Editions" or "x86 Editions" in exactly that case, it will trigger a false
' positive in our tests causing the wrong actions to be taken. This has been resolved.
'
' 16.0.6.125 - Apr 12, 2021
' Extremely minor change. When the program is run and a selected operation is completed, for example, the process of applying
' updates to Windows editions, the program will prompt you to press any key to return to the main menu. When a key is pressed
' there is no immediate visual indication that the keypress was accepted. On a fast computer there is only a momentary delay,
' but I believe that on a slower system there may be several seconds delay as everything is initialized. Since the program is
' purposely designed to buffer user input, we don't want the user to press further keys thinking that nothing has happened as
' these will be stored and played back. To remedy this we no immediately clear the screen and display a message to indicate
' that initialization is in progress.
'
' 16.1.0.126 - Apr 14, 2021
' While working with certain thumb drives that are supposed to be very fast, it was noted that the performance had slowed down
' to a crawl. By writing all zeros to these drives using the "CLEAN ALL" command in DISKPART, performance was restored. A
' thumb drive does not have TRIM support, however, in theory, there should be some sort of garbage collection capability
' which should do something similar.
'
' Since exFAT is the preferred format for larger thumb drives, it's possible that the garbage collection methods used by
' these thumb drives may simply not handle NTFS. As a result, for the routine in this program that creates bootable media, we
' have added an option to allow formatting of all partitions other than the first partition as exFAT rather than NTFS. The
' user can choose which they prefer. Note that at the start of the routine a variable named "UserCanPickFS$" is set to "TRUE"
' by default. By changing this in the code to "FALSE", this new functionality can be disabled and the program will then always
' use NTFS. This is considered experimental at this time since it's not know how well using exFAT on the boot media will work
' on all systems during Windows installation. This will be tested on a number of systems in the coming days.
'
' Starting with this release of the program we are moving to QB64 1.51 April 9, 2021 Development build for compiling.
'
' 16.1.1.127 - Apr 14, 2021
' Following some routine testing after the changes made in 16.1.0.126, it was discovered that a boot drive created by the program would
' not boot on a BIOS based system. There is a section of code where a determination is made as to whether the drive should be configured
' as MBR or GPT. Normally, the drive should be configured as MBR but due to a logic bug we never execute the command to convert the drive
' to MBR. This has been resolved.
'
' 16.1.2.128 - Apr 15, 2021
' One more minor fix. While formatting a slow SD card on a slow computer, BitLocker failed to initialize in the 30 second timeout that
' alotted. Increasing the timeout to 90 seconds. This should not slow the program down normally because we will move on once the
' BitLocker initialization is completed.
' Also cleaned up a few messages to make them easier to understand.
'
' 16.2.0.129 - Apr 18, 2021
' For the routine that exports drivers from a system, we've added one new feature: After exporting drivers a batch file will
' be created in the export directory for the purpose of installing all the exported drivers. The needs to simply run the
' batch file to install the drivers. Since this batch file is self-elevating, there is no need to remember to run elevated
' or to have to remind the user to do so.
'
' 16.2.1.130 - Apr 18, 2021
' Very minor revision to the batch file created as described in the release notes for 16.2.0.129. We have added text at the
' end of the routine indicating that a reboot may be needed. Also, we are hiding all the messages that would normally
' get displayed when drivers are exported as well as when they get installed by the batch file. It just looks so much
' cleaner without all those messages.
'
' 16.2.2.131 - Apr 19, 2021
' Found a rather bug that affected the routine that injects Windows updates, Windows drivers, and Boot Critical Drivers. For
' each of these routines, if we were updating x64 editions of Windows only and the updates or drivers folder did not contain
' a \x86 folder, the routine would display an error stating that no x86 updates or drivers could be found even though we
' were not processing any x86 editions. This issue is now resolved.
'
' 16.3.0.132 - Apr 19, 2021
' For the routine that creates a bootable disk, the manner in which the user was made to select the disk ID for
' the disk to be made bootable was very clunky. This entire portion of the routine has been completely reworked.
' It was now much easier to understand and navigate. In addition, error checking has been added so that a user
' cannot select a disk ID that does not exist. Finally, the program previously would not accept a disk ID of 0.
' However, the OS disk is not necessarily always disk 0, so disk 0 should be considered a legitimate response.
'
' 16.3.1.133 - Apr 19, 2021
' Changed a couple of messages for clarity.
'
' 16.3.2.134 - Apr 28, 2021
' Changed one message to make it look better. Text went only half way across the screen and then continued on the next line.
' It just look a bit sloppy. This is also the first version to be compiled on QB64 1.51 Apr 25, 2021 development build.
'
' 16.3.3.135 - May 22, 2021
' No program changes. The only change is that the program is now being compiled using QB64 v.1.51 May 22, 2021 Dev Build.
'
' 16.3.4.136 - June 5, 2021
' Updated the code that recreates BCD files on the fly to generate the new files from the 21H1 media.
'
' 16.3.5.137 - June 8, 2021
' This updates adds some enhancements to the AV exclusions. It was found that merely excluding the program
' executable was not sufficient. This update adds exclusion for the destination folder in the routines that
' inject updates, drivers, and boot-critical drivers. The folder name is logged to a temporary file. That
' way, if the program is terminated before the exclusion can be removed, when the program is started again
' it will detect that the exclusion was not removed and will then remove it when the program is started.
'
' 16.3.6.138 - June 15, 2021
' Changed the order of release notes so thatthe latest release is at the bottom rather than the top. With the
' release notes at the top, it was becoming a pain to find the latest note to add a new release note each time.
' By reversing the order of the release notes, it will now be much easier to update the notes.
'
' 16.4.0.139 - June 17, 2021
' For the routine that creates a bootable drive, we have added error detection for the robocopy commands that
' copy the data to the drives. This allows us to warn the user if an error is detected.
'
' In the process of updating this code, it was also found that the handling of the autounattend.xml file, if it exists
' on the source, was not being handled properly. This has been corrected.
'
' In the routine to create bootable media, we have a variable called "UserCanPickFS$". If set to "FALSE" then all partitions other
' than the first will automatically be created as NTFS. Set to "TRUE" it will allow the user the select whether to use NTFS or
' exFAT. We had this set to TRUE but we have now changed it to FALSE as this should be something that is almost never needed.
'
' Finally, starting with this build, we are compiling on QB64 1.51 June 14th 2021 Development Build.
'
' 16.4.1.140 - June 17, 2021
' Performed some additional cleanup of the routine to create bootable media. The displayed output is now much cleaner.
'
' 16.4.2.141 - June 17, 2021
' No changes to functioality, simply cleaned up some messages in the sections update in the last few builds.
'
' 16.4.3.142 - June 17, 2021
' Just some more housekeeping claifying a prompt to user to make it easier to understand.
'
' 16.5.0.143 - June 22, 2021
' For long running routines such as injecting Windows updates or drivers into an image, we have added the ability to
' specify whether the program should return to the main menu after running, or perform a system shutdown. To perform
' a system shutdown, the user should create a file named "Auto_Shutdown" (case does not matter) on the desktop. The
' status screen will update the status of auto shutdown after each step prior to a new step in the updare process
' being started. The user can create this file or delete / rename it even while the program is running.
'
' 16.5.1.144 - June 25, 2021
' Just a little minor change today. For the routine that creates or refreshes bootable media, we have provided a more
' friendly closing summary when the routine is done to reflect the options chosen by the user.
' Also fixed one other very minor issue. There are two messages that get displayed, one right below the other. The
' wording is exactly the same except for the number at the end of the message. One of these messages ended with a
' period, while the other did not. This just looked a little sloppy. It has been corrected by removing the period.
'
' 16.5.2.145 - July 6, 2021
' No change in functionality. Recompiled on QB64 1.51 July 6, 2021 Dev Build.
' Added a comment line after setting the variables that hold the current version and release date that notes the version
' of QB64 that this build is compiled on. This will simply make it a little easier to locate the QB64 compiler version
' used in the future.
'
' 16.6.0.146 - July 9, 2021
' We have revised the manner in which autounattend.xml answer files are handled. For all routines we will now exclude the
' autounattend.xml answer file if it exists. There are 2 exceptions to this rule:
'
' 1) For the routine to make or update a bootable drive from a Windows ISO image, we will ask the user if they want to
' exclude an answer file if one exists.
'
' 2) For the routine that creates a bootable ISO image from files in a folder we will INCLUDE the answer file if it is
' present since the user can simply delete it from the folder if they do not want it to be copied.
'
' Note that for the routine that injects Windows updates, it will exclude answer files from the original sources, but if
' you include an answer file in the "Answer_File" subfolder of the folder that you specify as the Windows updates location,
' this answer file will be copied.
'
' Finally, we have also renamed a few items on the main menu. We previously referenced ISO images where it would be more
' accurate to reference Windows editions.
'
' 16.6.1.147 - July 15, 2021
' Very minor update. Simply updated the comments in the first few lines of the program. Modified one reference to Windows 10
' to include Windows 11. In addition, removed a comment that referenced an older build of QB64.
'
' 16.6.2.148 - July 20, 2021
' Found that the routine to create the ei.cfg file if the user elects to create one was misplaced. This could cause that file
' to not be created even if the user elected to create it. This has been corrected.
' Corrected a typo in a path name. We had a path that should reference "ISO_Files" but it was spelled "xISO_Files".
' Corrected another spelling error where the word "least" was spelled "lease".
'
' 16.6.3.149 - August 2, 2021
' Added the ability to pause program execution. For the routines that inject updates, drivers, or boot-critical drivers,
' execution can use quite a few resources, especially disk resources. When viewing the status on the screen, as progress
' goes to the next item in the list, we will check the desktop for a file named "WIM_PAUSE.txt". If such a file exists,
' execution will be paused until that file is deleted or renamed. If execution is paused a flashing message will be
' displayed to make the user aware of this.
'
' 16.6.4.150 - August 12, 2021
' Modified routines that check for elevated status. The first routine to be altered is the routine right at the start of the
' program. It was found that if the program was saved with certain characters in the file name, this routine would fail. For
' example, if program were to be renamed to "John's Program.exe", then it would fail. This corrects that situation. As an
' added benefit, this change makes the startup look better. Previously, if the program was not started elevated, the
' process of closing the original program and then relaunching it elevated caused a visible second window to be opened before
' the first one was closed. With this change that is no longer an issue.
'
' In addition, the routine that exports drivers from the system creates a batch file that also has the code to self-elevate.
' That code was also updated to resolve the same problem of not working when the batch file has certain characters in the name.
'
' 16.7.0.151 - August 16, 2021
' For the routine that will create bootable Windows installation media, we have made some improvements to make the user
' experience better. First, we create an empty text file with a unique name to the first two partitions when a "Wipe"
' operation is performed. In the future, if the user wants to perform a "Refresh" operation, we will search for these files.
' The purpose of this is to detect if more than one bootable drive created with this program exists. If more than one such
' drive is connected, then we need to ask the user for the drive letters to be refreshed. Otherwise, if only a single such
' drive is connected, we automatically detect the drive letters to be updated so that we don't need to bother the user for
' those details.
'
' 16.7.1.152 - August 16, 2021
' Added a line to the main menu to indicate the edition (Dual Architure or x64 Only). The name of the source file and the
' resulting executable have also been changed to clearly differentiate between the editions.
'
' Undid a recent change to the self-elevating code. It turns out that this was causing the code to actually NOT self-elevate.
'
' 16.7.2.153 - August 17, 2021
' After further investigation into the self-elevating code issue, we now have a more robust solution. The comments in that
' section of code explain how it works.
'
' 16.7.3.154 - August 17, 2021
' For the routine that creates bootable media, we have increased the amount of time that we wait for BitLocker to initialize
' a disk if the user chooses to create BitLocker encrypted partitions. This should ensure that even very slow media, such as
' some thumb drives, have enough time to initialize. In addition, added a block of text to better guide the user when they
' choose to create additional partitions.
'
' 17.0.0.155 - August 26, 2021
' This is a major new release. Comprehensive help has been added to the program.
'
' 17.0.1.156 - August 26, 2021
' Added comments to the new help system in order to make the code easier to read and locate specific
' help topics within the code.
'
' 17.0.2.157 - August 31, 2021
' Performed some tidying-up of the text in the new help section.
'
' 18.0.0.158 - September 2, 2021
' Another new major version. For the routines that inject Windows updates, drivers, or boot-critical drivers, the program can
' automatically generate a script file complete with comments. The comments make it easy to manually modify or "tweak" the
' script file. These script files can then be played back automatically by the program.
'
' 18.1.0.159 - September 2, 2021
' Added the ability still create a script without actually having to carry out an injection of updates, drivers, or boot-critical
' updates. Also improved the look of the screen asking if user wants to perform any scripting operations.
'
' 18.1.1.160 - September 2, 2021
' Added a hint to the status screens to remind user that they can use AUTO_SHUTDOWN.TXT and WIM_PAUSE.TXT files on desktop
' to perform an automatic shutdown or pause the program execution.
'
' 18.1.2.161 - September 3, 2021
' Bug fix - the final ISO image created by the routines to inject Windows updates, drivers, and boot-critical drivers was
' lacking the ".ISO" extension on the filename. This has been resolved. Also fixed a bug where script file may fail to be
' moved to the program directory after it is created.
'
' 18.1.3.162 - September 3, 2021
' Bug fix - In the help section, the organization of drivers for the routine that injects drivers did not accurately
' show the folder structure that should be used. Made a few other changes to the help for clarification purposes.
'
' 18.1.4.163 - September 7, 2021
' Confirmed for sure that there are times where the ei.cfg file is still needed. Fortunately, this was never removed from the code
' as originally planned. We simply gave a user the option to insert an ei.cfg file or not. Removed any comments from the code that
' stated that this file may no longer be needed, but leaving the functionality alone.
'
' 18.1.5.164 - September 8, 2021
' Refined the help message regarding the injection of an EI.CFG file to make the purpose of that file clearer. In addition, in other
' places in the program, when a user wants to see help, any response staring with the letter "H" would be acceptable to get help.
' This did not work for the prompt for an EI.CFG file. This has been changed to be more consistent with the rest of the program.
'
' 18.1.6.165 - September 16, 2021
' Rewrote the "pause" routine. This was a very simple routine that simply printed a blank line and then paused execution of the
' program until the user hit a key. The pause was accomplished by running the command line utility "pause" from a QB64 "shell"
' statement. For most purposes this is fine, except that it would not take input from the QB64 keyboard buffer. As a result,
' taking a series of commands and pasting them into the program would not work when a pause is encountered. This also has the
' potential to cause problems if we want to expand scripting capabilities in the future. The rewrite of this routine solves this.
'
' 18.1.7.166 - September 17, 2021
' We have 2 two "DO...LOOP" structures in the rewritten "PAUSE" code. These loops run forever waiting for a key press and release.
' Revised these structures so that they only look for a press or release 50 times per second to avoid hammering the CPU.
'
' 18.1.8.167 - September 24, 2021
' Fixed a bug that only happens when program goes back to start and reinitializes. For example, after a routine is run to completion
' and we return to the main menu. Right near the start of the program we stored the current working directory in a variable so that
' we knew the location from where the program was started. However, we then change the working directory to a temporary location
' where we can create temporary files. When jumping back to the start, we clear all variables and loose track of the original
' working directory. As a result, it is essential that we change the current working directory back to the original location before
' we jump back to the beginning of the program.
'
' Also added a note in the help for scripting to make users aware that changing contents of directories can cause script failures.
'
' Finally, the shutdown option was not working when the system was locked. The program was missing a "/f" option to force the
' shutdown. Without this, a shutdown cannot be performaed when the system is locked. We also provide a chance to abort shutdown.
'
' 18.2.0.168 - September 26, 2021
' Made some significant changes specifically to better accomodate scripting. If the number of files in a source folder changed,
' this would break scripting because it changes your responses when the program asks if you want to update each individual file.
' To eliminate this problem, the program will now allow you to specify a full path including a file name. This way the program
' does not need to inquire about each file because you are specifying each file unambiguously.
'
' In addition, the script files are now a little easier to read and manually modify.
'
' 18.2.1.169 - September 27, 2021
' Further refinements to the scripting. The script files are much easier to read and edit. Blank lines are now legal and not interpreted
' as an <ENTER>. An <ENTER> is now explicitly shown with an "<ENTER>" tag in the script.
'
' 18.2.2.170 - September 27, 2021
' Bug fix. In the process of adjusting scripting settings, we caused a display problem for those routines that want to show index details
' but do not honor scripting settings (playback, record, or skip). This has been resolved.
'
' 19.0.0.172 - October 5, 2021 (The Windows 11 Release Day Edition)
' This is a major new version!
' The option to create bootable media now has 2 options. The previously existing option to create a single Windows boot option along
' with multiple generic partitions to hold other data remains as was. However, we now have the option to create media that allows for
' multiple bootable partitions. For example, you could boot Windows 10 setup / recovery media, Windows 11 setup / recovery media, Macrium
' reflect recovery media, and any other Windows PE/RE based bootable media, as well as several generic partitions for holding any other
' desired data. This functionality is only for x64 / UEFI based systems and not BIOS or x86 based systems.
'
' 19.0.1.173 - October 5, 2021
' Bug fix. Even if a user did not want to hide operating system and Windows PE / RE partition drive letters, we were hiding them
' anyway. This has been fixed.
'
' 19.0.2.174 - October 11, 2021
' Minor change. Reworded some text in the routine that reorders Windows editions within an image for clarity.
'
' 19.0.3.175 - Octoner 12, 2021
' Fixed a bug where we were skipping over an entire section of code becase we had a call to a subroutine commented out.
'
' 19.0.4.176 - October 12, 2021
' Bug fix: Still dealing with the code to create bootable media. Under a specific set of circumstances we were running the
' code to ask the user what disk write the image to twice. This has been resolved.
'
' 19.0.5.177 - October 13, 2021
' Minor change - Updated some text displayed to user for clarity.
'
' 19.1.0.178 - October 20, 2021
' Microsoft now distributes the the SSU and LCU in one combined package. We have changed our code to work with this new model.
' Note that this may look a bit odd at time becaue we apply the LCU and then apply it again. This is because the first time the
' SSU get applied, the second time, the LCU gets applied. Note that if we were loading certain optional components such as language
' packs, etc., these componts would get installed right between thos two occurences of the LCU update for both WinRE and WinPE (boot.wim).
'
' 19.1.1.179 - October 21, 2021
' Added a couple of lines to the section of code that cleans up project files. In rare circumstances, a user could abort the program
' at a point in time where cleanup of files becomes difficult. We've added a couple lines to try to even more aggressively try to
' cleanup such files.
'
' 19.1.2.180 - October 21, 2021
' Changed some wording of on screen progress indicator. With the new combined SSU and LCU updates, it appears that if an SSU exists,
' the first pass (where the SSU would be applied) completes rather quickly, and then the LCU is added on the second pass which can
' take quite a while. However, if no SSU exists, then it seems that the first pass already applies the LCU and the second pass
' completes almost instantly since there is nothing left to be done. The wording of the progress screens is now changed to reflect
' the fact that the SSU and LCU are combined and we simply call the 2 passes "pass 1" and "pass 2".
'
' 19.1.3.181 - October 23, 2021
' Changed the wording of a few messages in the routine to extract the contents of .CAB files for clarity.
'
' 19.1.4.182 - October 25, 2021
' Changed wording on a menu item.
'
' 19.1.5.183 - November 24, 2021
' For the option to display WIM image information, we have added a few lines at the end of the output to show the build number of the
' Windows editions in the image. Help has been updated to note that this information is displayed.
'
' 19.1.6.184 - November 27, 2021
' For the option to display Windows image information, this dual architecture version was different from the x64 only version of the
' program in that it displayed the Windows build information after the info for each individual edition. This doesn't look that great
' and is inconsistent with the other version. The code was reworked to correct this situation.
'
' 19.1.7,185 - January 11, 2022
' For the routine that injects updates, after the user enters a filename or path for the source, we need to determine if what was
' entered is a filename or a path. There was a bug in this logic causing a fault in the program if a path was entered. This is now
' resolved.
'
' 19.1.8.186 - January 12, 2022
' When updates are being injected into Windows images, the screen that shows the current progress is very much reliant upon being
' properly sized as 120 x 30. If the user has either accidentally or purposely changed the size of the program window, the status
' screen will not look very good at all. As a result, each time we refresh the status display, we will now reset the screen to
' a size of 120 x 30.
'
' 19.2.0.187 - January 13, 2022
' We had previously introducednew functionality to the routine for creating bootable media to allow for the creation of media that
' could boot multiple Operating Systems and / or WinPE / WinRE based media such as various recovery disks, etc. This routine is
' being removed at this time, but may be added back at a later date. There are several reasons for this:
'
' 1) We have seen several occurences of BSODs with no clear understanding yet of the cause.
' 2) The result looks sloppy - there is no nice boot menu and the resulting boot is also inconsistent on different systems. On some
'    systems you will see a boot menu item for each partition (both FAT32 and NTFS) while some systems show only the FAT32
'    partitions. It just looks sloppy and seems a little half-baked when compared to the rest of this program.
'
' 19.2.1.188 - January 14, 2022
' Permanently removed the option that we described as having disabled in the Jan 13, 2022 release notes. It's clear that if we are
' ever to bring back this functionality a major rewrite of that code would be needed.
'
' 19.2.2.189 - January 17, 2022
' Rewording of a menu item and help text for improved clarity.
'
' 19.2.3.190 - January 24, 2022
' Added the ability to easily switch the program between applying separate SSU updates or combined LCU / SSU updates.
' At the start of routine to inject updates, if we set ProcessSeparateSSU to 1, then we process a separate SSU update.
' If set to 0, then we process a combined LCU / SSU update.
'
' 19.2.4.191 - January 25, 2022
' When injecting Windows updates, there was a logic flaw. At the end of the process, we were moving the install.wim to the final
' destination. However, this results in a significantly larger file. Rather than simply moving it, we should be exporting each
' index to the destination. We correctly perform a cleanup operation on the install.wim, however, the cleanup has no effect on
' the size until an export is performed. So, as a result of neglecting to perform the export, we miss out on the benefit of the
' cleanup that was performed earlier. This has now been corrected.
'
' 19.2.5.192 - January 25, 2022
' Found that there was still a discrepancy in the size of final ISO image created by a batch file that I was using and this
' program. Noted that there was a significant difference in the boot.wim size. That led to the discovery that a variable I
' was using was wrong in some places. There was both a SSU_Update_Avail$ and an SSU_Update_Avail$. This has been corrected.
' In addition, we were moving the original boot.wim to the final location rather than the updated file. This too has been corrected.
'
' 19.3.0.193 - February 10, 2022
' If in an effort to finally put the issue of how to properly apply combined LCU / SSU updates, we have performed so testing. Microsoft
' documentation says that SSU updates should be applied first, followed by certain other updates, and then the LCU should be applied.
' From my testing, it looks like this information is now outdated. For an online installation of Windows this may still apply, but it
' seems that for an offline servicing of a Windows image, the following should be done:
'
' 1) For WinRE.WIM - Apply the combined LCU / SSU update at the time where the SSU would normally be applied.
' 2) For BOOT.WIM (WinPE) - Apply the combined LCU / SSU update at the time where the LCU was previously applied and apply nothing where the
'    SSU was previously applied.
' 3) For INSTALL.WIM (the main OS) - Apply the combined LCU / SSU update at the time where the LCU was previously applied and apply nothing
'    where the SSU was previously applied.
'
' 19.3.1.194 - February 12, 2022
' Noticed recently that performing a "clean" within diskpart on a flash drive will often fail the first time it is run. Oddly, it always works
' the second time. It seems that this affects not only manually running the command, but affects this program as well. As a result, we simply
' run the "clean" command twice.
'
' 19.3.2.195 - February 13, 2022
' Came accross a program that needs to access the .WIM files in a Windows image. For some silly reason, this program is sensitive to the case
' of the file names, wanting only lowercase characters. There are places in the program where we were saving these file names using uppercase
' characters. This has been changed to use all lowercase.
'
' In addition, we have made a change to all ISO image creation routines. The timestamp of all files added to the image will now be set to the
' time at which the creation of the image was started. This will allow for easy identification of when an image was created.

' Further refinement to the "clean" operation on media that we are writing to. There is a problem where performing a "clean" in diskpart will
' sometimes fail the first time. It usually works the second time but in testing with batch files we have seen failures even on the second
' time. The failures only seem to happen on MBR disks. As a result, we are performing a clean operation twice, attempting to set it to GPT
' each time. Finally, after a third clean we set it to the final desired state of either GPT or MBR.

' Very minor changes to wording of some text in help. No functional changes in this update.
'
' 19.3.5.198 - March 16, 2022
' Another minor change: The routine to display Windows image information is one of the few pieces in this program that was intended to be able
' to handle both images that contain an install.wim file(s) as well as those that use install.esd file(s). This worked fine for dual architecture
' images, but we were not handling it correctly for single architecture images. This has now been corrected. Along with this change we changed
' the temporary test file that was used to store information from WIM_Info.txt to Image_Info.txt.
'
' 20.0.0.199 - March 18, 2022
' Major new release: Added a new feature to the menu. There are a lot of people who have ISO images using an install.esd rather than an
' install.wim. There are occasions where the release of an image with .wim may be delayed by a few days and only the .esd version of the
' image is available. As a result, we now have the ability to convert an image with an install.esd into an image with an install.wim.
' This feature supports both single and dual architecture images.
'
' 20.0.1.200 - March 19, 2022
' Revised the help menu so that help topics align with the actual menu item numbers. Previously, the numbers were offset by one. For
' example, menu item 1 was help topic 2.
'
' 20.0.2.201 - March 20, 2022
' Very minor update: In the built-in help, under the topic for the routine that injects drivers into Windows images, on the third page of
' the help topic "5) Organizing update files", there is a section for "SSU". This topic has been removed since Microsoft has now switched
' to a combined LCU / SSU model. This means that an SSU folder is no longer needed and a seperate SSU does not need to be downloaded.
'
' 20.0.3.202 - March 21, 2022
' At the last moment prior to compiling the last release, we accidentally introduced a bug causing the final image to not be created in the
' new routine that converts ESD images into WIM images. This has been fixed.
