**********************************

v19.0.1.173 - A quick bug fix. We were hiding partitions even when a user chose option not to hide partitions. This has been resolved.

v19.0.0.172 - For the routine to create bootable media, we've add a whole new capability. Up until now, you could create a single bootable item but you could add additional partitions for other data on the same disk. We have now added the capability to create bootable media that can allow you to choose between multiple items. For example, you might be able to choose between Windows 10, Windows 11, a Macrium Reflect recovery disk, and more. At the same time you could still have additional partitions. Note that this option works only with x64 UEFI based systems, however, especially now with the release of Windows 11, x86 BIOS based systems are becoming less common and you may never need to deal it. Note that the new mode for creation of multiple bootable partitions does not yet have BitLocker support or the ability to refresh partitions with updates. For the moment, both of these operations can be easily accomplished manually but those features are coming soon.

v18.2.0.168 - Made some significant changes specifically to better accomodate scripting. If the number of files in a source folder changed, this would break scripting because it changes your responses when the program asks if you want to update each individual file. To eliminate this problem, the program will now allow you to specify a full path including a file name. This way the program does not need to inquire about each file because you are specifying each file unambiguously. In addition, the script files are now a little easier to read and manually modify.

v18.1.8.167 - Fixed a bug that only happens when program goes back to start and reinitializes. For example, after a routine is run to completion and we return to the main menu. Right near the start of the program we stored the current working directory in a variable so that we knew the location from where the program was started. However, we then change the working directory to a temporary location where we can create temporary files. When jumping back to the start, we clear all variables and loose track of the original working directory. As a result, it is essential that we change the current working directory back to the original location before we jump back to the beginning of the program.

Also added a note in the help for scripting to make users aware that changing contents of directories can cause script failures.

Finally, the shutdown option was not working when the system was locked. The program was missing a "/f" option to force the shutdown. Without this, a shutdown cannot be performaed when the system is locked. We also provide a chance to abort shutdown.

v18.1.7.166 - In the newly rewritten "PAUSE" routine, we have 2 loops that wait for a key press and a key release. These loops were running at an unlimited speed which could cause high CPU utilization. Revised the code so that these loops run only 50 times per second.

v18.1.6.165 - Rewrote the "pause" routine. This was a very simple routine that simply printed a blank line and then paused execution of the program until the user hit a key. The pause was accomplished by running the command line utility "pause" from a QB64 "shell" statement. For most purposes this is fine, except that it would not take input from the QB64 keyboard buffer. As a result, taking a series of commands and pasting them into the program would not work when a pause is encountered. This also has the potential to cause problems if we want to expand scripting capabilities in the future. The rewrite of this routine solves this.
