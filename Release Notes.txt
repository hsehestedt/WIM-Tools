v21.4.0.232

Improved - Performed an overhaul of the routine that creates a VHD and deploys Windows to it. This includes a bug fix and much better communication to the user of steps that they need to take.

Improved - For the routine "Make or update a bootable drive from one or more Windows / WinPE / WinRE ISO images", when all operations have been completed, we display usage instructions to the user. We have improved the handling of the keyboard buffer so that key presses during execution will not cause these messages to be dismissed. We have done the same in several other locations within the code.

Improved - In the routine to create a universal, bootable UFD, we made a change to create a batch file that gets saved on volume 2. That batch file allows the UFD to be custom configured without having to boot from the UFD. We also updated the text that is displayed after the UFD is created to explain how this batch file can be used.

Improved - Rearchitected parts of the routine to create a bootable disk that allows for the selection from multiple ISO images. The routine now creates a single batch file that can be used to check the status of the disk, to select an image to make bootable, or to revert the disk back to the state where no image is yet selected.

Improved - The method used to inject Servicing Stack Updates (SSU) has been completely rearchitected. Microsoft listed a known issue in the latest Windows patches for which a workaround is listed. That issue affects only people who inject updates into Windows images, which is a major function of this program. While the method we used still works fine, the workaround noted by Microsoft for their issue describes how Microsoft recommends installing a combined SSU / LCU update. Previously, Microsoft did not describe how to do this. As a result, we were using a method devised by trial and error. While this method works fine, we are now applying the SSU using the method described by Microsoft.

Bug fix - For robocopy commands, we often have error checking code to make sure that we have not run out of space on the destination. However, the error correction was never triggered because robocopy tries over and over after a 30 second delay. To resolve this, we have added an "/r:0" to the robocopy commands to tell robocopy not to retry. This will allow the code to fall through to the error checking code.

Bug fix -  Fixed some flaws in the routine to inject boot critical drivers.

Distibution Change - For sake of ease, we are packaging all files other than the release notes into a single ZIP file.


*****************************************************
* Advanced Notice of Intent to Change Functionality *
*****************************************************

Currently, WIM Tools supports both x64 and x86 editions of Windows, allowing for the inclusion of both architecture types in the same project. With the release of Windows 11, Microsoft has eliminated support for x86 editions. At this time, we already have (and have had for quite a while already) an x64 only edition of WIM Tools, allowing for much simplification of the code. The two editions of WIM Tools are maintained side by side and have feature parity, with the exception of x86 only and dual architecture functionality. The intention is to maintain both editions up until Windows 10 goes out of support in late 2025. At that time we plan to cut over to the x64 only edition of WIM Tools and suspend further updates to the Dual Architecture edition. In the meantime, we distribute here the Dual Architecture edition to provide the greatest set of capabilities and features.

v21.1.1.219

Major new version

NEW: Added the ability to create a bootable disk that can contain as many different ISO images as you wish. These can include various versions of Windows as well as Windows PE and Windows RE based media.

Bug Fix: The program was not working with paths and filenames that contain commas. This has been corrected.


v20.1.2.208

Completely revised the logging subsystem to make it simpler. Logs were sometimes being generated that were 600MB+ in size and this was getting out of hand. We have also made one small change to the behavior of the routine that converts ESD files to WIM. Since we are simply performing a conversion and not altering the image in any other way, we are no longer altering the timestamp of files when we create the final ISO image.

Enhanced the auto shutdown capablity by allowing the user to request a hibernation rather than a shutdown. This will better support wake-on-LAN capabilities. Place a file named auto_shutdown.txt on the desktop to perform a shutdown when the program has finished running or an auto_hibernate.txt to hibernate. NOTE: This is used only by the routine to inject updates / drivers / boot-critical drivers into the image since these can be a long running operations.

Made some changes to the program startup. When a new version of the program is run for the first time, we display a message encouraging the review of the online help.

If system settings prevent the code from self-elevating (re-running itself if the program was not run as administrator), we now display a message to the user advising them to re-run the program as administrator.

Bug-fix: When updates were injected into an image using a script, some messages that should be displayed to the user could be skipped. This has been fixed.

Bug-fix: There was a piece of code where a wrong file name was referenced. This caused a minor cosmetic issue, no problem to program functionality was created by this.

Documentation: We are eliminating the PDF documentation with this build. Everything needed is now built into the program itself so it eliminates the need for the separate documentation.

v20.0.3.202

Bug Fix - Introduced a bug at the last moment before posting of the last release that caused the final image to not be created. This has been fixed. 

v20.0.1.200

Major new release: 

New Feature: Added a new feature to the menu. There are a lot of people who have ISO images using an install.esd rather than an install.wim. There are occasions where it may be difficult to obtain a release of an image with .wim and only the .esd version of the image is available. As a result, we now have the ability to convert an image with an install.esd into an image with an install.wim.

This feature supports both single and dual architecture images. Please note that we currently support conversion of the entire ISO image only. Once converted to an image with a .wim, you can use the available routines in this program to create a new image with only the Windows editions that you want / require.

Updated: Revised the help menu so that help topics align with the actual menu item numbers. Previously, the numbers were offset by one. For example, menu item 1 was help topic 2. The help topic numbers now align with the numbers on the main menu precisely to avoid any potential confusion.

v19.3.4.197

New: When using the routine to display WIM information, we now display the build number.

Change: We have encountered a program that needs to access the WIM files contained in a Windows ISO image. That program fails if the .WIM extension is not in lowercase. While not technically a problem with this program, we now save all WIM files with a lowercase extension.

Change: When creating an ISO image, the timestamp of files will be set to the time that the ISO image creation was started in order to allow easy identification of when that image was created. Note that when booting from media or an ISO created by the program, when Windows setup displays the list of available editions, the timestamp of those editions are NOT altered.

Change: We had previously introducednew functionality to the routine for creating bootable media to allow for the creation of media that could boot multiple Operating Systems and / or WinPE / WinRE based media such as various recovery disks, etc. This routine is being removed at this time, but may be added back at a later date. There are several reasons for this:

1) We have seen several occurences of BSODs with no clear understanding yet of the cause.
2) The result looks sloppy - there is no nice boot menu and the resulting boot is also inconsistent on different systems. On some systems you will see a boot menu item for each partition (both FAT32 and NTFS) while some systems show only the FAT32 partitions. It just looks sloppy and seems a little half-baked when compared to the rest of this program.

Fix: For the routine to inject Windows updates, a user can enter a path to a location with one or more Windows images, or they can enter a full path with a specific filename included. There was a logic fault when a path without a filename was entered. This has been resolved.

Fix: When updates are being applied, the screen showing current status is designed to be displayed at 120 colums by 30 rows of text. If a user purposely or accidentally changes the screen size, this display will look very poor. To correct for this, with each status update we now resize the window to thew proper size.

Fix: When injecting Windows updates, there was a logic flaw. At the end of the process, we were moving the install.wim to the final destination. However, this results in a significantly larger file. Rather than simply moving it, we should be exporting each index to the destination. We correctly perform a cleanup operation on the install.wim, however, the cleanup has no effect on the size until an export is performed. So, as a result of neglecting to perform the export, we miss out on the benefit of the cleanup that was performed earlier. This has now been corrected.

Fix: Recently, it has been noticed that the "clean" command when issued in diskpart, would sometime fail the first time it is run. We have implemented a fix that should fix this. We have seen no problems since implementing this workaround.

Other: Some minor rewording of messages and help have been made to make these easier to understand.

v19.1.4.182

Bug fix: Under a specific set of circumstances we were running the code to ask the user what disk to write the image to twice. This has been resolved.

Enhanced: Microsoft now distributes the the SSU and LCU in one combined package. We have changed our code to work with this new model.

Enhanced: Added a couple of lines to the section of code that cleans up project files. In rare circumstances, a user could abort the program at a point in time where cleanup of files becomes difficult. We've added a couple lines to try to even more aggressively try to
cleanup such files.

Enhanced: Changed some wording of on screen progress indicator. With the new combined SSU and LCU updates, if an SSU exists, the first pass (where the SSU would be applied) completes rather quickly, and then the LCU is added on the second pass which can
take quite a while. However, if no SSU exists, then it the first pass already applies the LCU and the second pass completes almost instantly since there is nothing left to be done. The wording of the progress screens is now changed to reflect the fact that the SSU and LCU are combined and we simply call the 2 passes "pass 1" and "pass 2".

Other Minor Fixes and Changes: Changed the wording of a few messages in the routine to extract the contents of .CAB files for clarity.

Changed wording on a menu item.

v19.0.3.175 - Fixed a critical bug where we were skipping an entire section of code because we accidentally commented out a line of code.

v19.0.1.173 - A quick bug fix. We were hiding partitions even when a user chose option not to hide partitions. This has been resolved.

v19.0.0.172 - For the routine to create bootable media, we've add a whole new capability. Up until now, you could create a single bootable item but you could add additional partitions for other data on the same disk. We have now added the capability to create bootable media that can allow you to choose between multiple items. For example, you might be able to choose between Windows 10, Windows 11, a Macrium Reflect recovery disk, and more. At the same time you could still have additional partitions. Note that this option works only with x64 UEFI based systems, however, especially now with the release of Windows 11, x86 BIOS based systems are becoming less common and you may never need to deal it. Note that the new mode for creation of multiple bootable partitions does not yet have BitLocker support or the ability to refresh partitions with updates. For the moment, both of these operations can be easily accomplished manually but those features are coming soon.v18.2.0.168 - Made some significant changes specifically to better accomodate scripting. If the number of files in a source folder changed, this would break scripting because it changes your responses when the program asks if you want to update each individual file. To eliminate this problem, the program will now allow you to specify a full path including a file name. This way the program does not need to inquire about each file because you are specifying each file unambiguously. In addition, the script files are now a little easier to read and manually modify.

v18.1.8.167 - Fixed a bug that only happens when program goes back to start and reinitializes. For example, after a routine is run to completion and we return to the main menu. Right near the start of the program we stored the current working directory in a variable so that we knew the location from where the program was started. However, we then change the working directory to a temporary location where we can create temporary files. When jumping back to the start, we clear all variables and loose track of the original working directory. As a result, it is essential that we change the current working directory back to the original location before we jump back to the beginning of the program.

Also added a note in the help for scripting to make users aware that changing contents of directories can cause script failures.

Finally, the shutdown option was not working when the system was locked. The program was missing a "/f" option to force the shutdown. Without this, a shutdown cannot be performaed when the system is locked. We also provide a chance to abort shutdown.

v18.1.7.166 - In the newly rewritten "PAUSE" routine, we have 2 loops that wait for a key press and a key release. These loops were running at an unlimited speed which could cause high CPU utilization. Revised the code so that these loops run only 50 times per second.

v18.1.6.165 - Rewrote the "pause" routine. This was a very simple routine that simply printed a blank line and then paused execution of the program until the user hit a key. The pause was accomplished by running the command line utility "pause" from a QB64 "shell" statement. For most purposes this is fine, except that it would not take input from the QB64 keyboard buffer. As a result, taking a series of commands and pasting them into the program would not work when a pause is encountered. This also has the potential to cause problems if we want to expand scripting capabilities in the future. The rewrite of this routine solves this.
