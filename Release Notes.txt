* How to Run the Program *
**************************

You can run the provided EXE file or, if you want to make any changes or customizations, compile the .bas source file using QB64 Phoenix Edition which can be obtained here:

https://github.com/QB64-Phoenix-Edition/QB64pe/releases/tag/v3.9.1

It is suggested that you see the system requirements for full functionality. To do so, run the program, select option 18 from the main menu for Program help, then option 19, and finally option 1 for system requirements.

* Virus Warnings *
******************

Antivirus software will sometimes flag this program as containing malicious code. This is a false indication! The included .bas file (a plain text file) is the source for the entire program. Feel free to review it. The program itself consists of a sinle EXE  file produced by the compiler. Ironically, antivirus software will especially interfere with Microsoft's own DISM utility when commiting changes to a WIM file. It is suggested that you set virus exclusions for these items:

1) The program executable itself.
2) The project location (the location you specify when running the program).

Note that if you use Windows defender, you only need to address item 1 as the program will take care of setting / unsetting an exclusion for item 2 itself.

* Changes in the Current Release *
**********************************

v23.0.0.261

MAJOR CHANGE: We have accelerated our abandonment of support for 32-bit Windows. I am simply no longer seeing any demand for support of 32-bit Windows. With the upcoming end of Windows 10, we will finally be in a 64-bit only Windows environment so there is simply no sense in pushing forward with support of 32-bit OS support. If you need 32-bit support, you can continue to use version 22.3.0.260 of this program (the last version to support 32-bit Windows).

Change is Version Numbers: With the change to 64-bit only support, we are upgrading the major version number to 23.

NEW FEATURE: For multi-image boot disk projects, if an answer file is selected, we report which answer file is in use.

FIX: Creation of generic ISO images would sometimes result in media that was not readable. This has been resolved.

NEW FEATURE: Microsoft has a new type of update - The OOBE ZDP update. The program now supports this and documents it in Help.

IMPROVED: Improved support for combined LCU / SSU packages.

FIX: Release Preview editions of Windows 11 24H2 were not working when a boot disk was made with those images. This has been resolved.

FIX: When altering the NAME and DESCRIPTION metadata for a Windows edition using this program, updating those fields for more than one edition at a time was not working. This has been resolved.

* Known Issues *
****************

IMPORTANT ISSUE:

Currently, you should not attempt to inject Windows updates into Windows 11 24H2 images. Windows 24H2 is not yet officially released and there are known issues with application of updates to the ISO image. Unfortunately, we do not yet have the resources available to address this until that version is fully released for Intel architecture CPUs and the first updates are released for that version.

Issue:

Double Spaces in File Names / Path: If you have a path or file name that has two spaces in a row, the program may not correctly handle this.

Workaround:

Eliminate any double spaces found in the path or file name. We'll look into this for possible resolution in a future release.
