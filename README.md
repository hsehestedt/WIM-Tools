# WIM-Tools
WIM (Windows Image Management) Tools is a set of tools to create, modify, and manage your Windows images

Here are of some of the things that you can do with WIM Tools:

- Inject Windows updates into one or more editions of Windows (Home, Pro, Education, etc.) and then combine them all into a single Windows image.

- Inject drivers including boot-critical drivers into one or more editions of Windows (Home, Pro, Education, etc.) and then combine them all into a single Windows image.

- Take a Windows image and create a bootable disk from it. This bootable disk will be bootable from BIOS and UEFI based systems, both x64 and x86, it will support files larger than 4 GB, and will boot on systems that don't like to boot from NTFS formatted media. In addition, this tool will allow for the creation of additional partitions on your media that can be optionally BitLocker encrypted. The Windows images saved can be refreshed without affecting the other partitions on the media.

- If you have a Windows image extracted to a disk for modification or to add / remove files, WIM Tools can create a new bootable image from those files.

- WIM Tools can create a new Windows image that pulls editions of Windows from several sources and combines them all into a single image.

- The contents of a Windows image can be re-organized and images can be added or removed from the image.

- Windows image metadata can be altered

- Your images can include both x64 and x86 editions of Windows in the same image.

- Several additional tools are included that will help you manage your WIM Tools projects.
